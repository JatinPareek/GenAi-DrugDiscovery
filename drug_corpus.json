cation channel and overexpression of 2E led to the generation of a distinct type of large extracellular vesicles 2EEVs Although 2EEVs have been demonstrated to facilitate viral transmission in a receptorindependent way the characteristics and biogenesis mechanism remain enigmatic Via lipidomics and proteomic analysis we found 2EEVs are distinct from endosomederived exosomes 2EEVs are notably enriched in Golgi apparatus components aligning with the observed fragmentation in Golgi morphology Through live cell imaging we established a connection between 2EEVs formation Golgi fragmentation

Nucleocytoplasmatic transport plays an essential role in eukaryotic cell homeostasis and is mediated by karyopherins Importin \u03b21 KPNB1 and its adaptor protein importin \u03b11 KPNA2 are the bestcharacterized karyopherins that effect nuclear import Here we identify a novel smallmolecule inhibitor of the importin \u03b21mediated nuclear import We design a reporter cell line by stably tagging endogenous importin \u03b11 with a fluorescent protein to screen for compounds affecting its subcellular localization We identify a series of compounds that trigger cytoplasmatic accumulation of importin \u03b11 The lead compound ibetazol is further characterized in a broad sequence of cellular nuclear transport assays Ibetazol is shown to inhibit all importin \u03b21mediated nuclear import quickly and specifically without affecting transport mediated by other karyopherins Detailed molecular mechanism of action studies demonstrate that ibetazol inhibits importin \u03b21 by covalently targeting Cys585 In summary ibetazol is a novel small molecule inhibitor of importin \u03b21 enabling pharmacological inhibition of the importin \u03b21mediated nuclear import process with

Currently all FDAapproved antiviral drugs against SARSCoV2 are RdRp or 3CLpro inhibitors However the mutations causing drug resistance have been observed in RdRp and 3CLpro from SARSCoV2 which makes it necessary to develop antivirals with novel mechanisms Through the application of a structurebased drug design SBDD approach we discover a series of novel potent noncovalent PLpro inhibitors with remarkable in vitro potency and in vivo PK properties The cocrystal structures of PLpro with lead compounds reveal that the residues D164 and Q269 around the S2 site are critical for improving the inhibitors potency The lead compound GZNLP36 not only inhibits SARSCoV2 and its variants at the cellular level with EC50 ranging from 582 nM to 3062 nM but also inhibits HCoVNL63 and HCoV229E with EC50 of 816 nM and 266 \u03bcM respectively Oral administration of the GZNLP36 results in significantly improved survival and notable reductions in lung viral loads and lesions in SARSCoV2 infection

Cholecystokinin CCK and gastrin are gastrointestinal hormones traditionally recognised for their roles in digestion However it has been recognised that these hormones may also modulate immune function Here we examine the immunemodulating effects of CCK and gastrin and explore the functional significance of this dual role In addition to the direct effect of these hormones on immune cell function we discuss why hormones that regulate complex physiological and behavioural aspects of digestion might also influence immune responses Notably recent findings highlight the importance of these hormones in promoting a tolerogenic hepatic environment particularly as the liver encounters gutderived inflammogens following a meal Additionally the neuroimmune crosstalk mediated by CCK suggests that this hormone may influence immune responses indirectly via the gutbrain axis especially in the context of infection or inflammation Furthermore the role of CCK in inducing feeding cessation and satiety appears to be repurposed during sickness behaviour such as the loss of appetite during infection Collectively these observations suggest that nutritional strategies including permissive underfeeding or fasting could have important clinical implications A deeper understanding of the dual roles of CCK and gastrin in digestion and immunity may pave the way for novel therapeutic approaches that

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE Buyang Huanwu Decoction BYHWD a traditional prescription known for its Supplementing Qi and Promoting Blood Circulation has demonstrated noteworthy therapeutic roles in regulating macrophage polarization to atherosclerosis AS However its underlying mechanisms remain unknown AIM OF THE STUDY The purpose of this paper was to decipher mechanism of BYHWD in regulating macrophage polarization to alleviate AS MATERIALS AND METHODS A comprehensive virtual screening strategy incorporating network pharmacology and batch molecular docking combined with experimental validation techniques was employed to systematically elucidate the underlying mechanism of BYHWD regulating macrophage polarization to alleviate AS RESULTS Firstly based on highfat diet induced AS model in apolipoprotein Edeficient mice it was found that BYHWD can significantly regulate macrophage polarization to alleviate AS Then the network pharmacological analysis revealed that the core targets of BYHWD regulating macrophage polarization to alleviate AS mainly involved TP53 AKT1 and BCL2 The mitochondrial function and metabolism were the main biological processes Meanwhile the main chemical components were identified as 3Opcoumaroylquinic acid Dmandelonitrile Ellagic acid Ferulic acid 5hydroxyLtryptophan zwitterion Isoliquiritigenin SenkyunolideF Anofinic acid Trimethylhydroquinone and SenkyunolideE by batch molecular docking strategy Further the in vitro experiments demonstrated that BYHWD not only regulated macrophage polarization and alleviated macrophage foam formation but also modulated mitochondrial function and the expression of TP53 pAKT and BCL2 proteins Finally multivariate statistical analysis confirmed that the ameliorative effect of BYHWD on AS was closely related to mitochondrial function and macrophage polarization regulated by TP53 AKT1 and BCL2 CONCLUSIONS BYHWD could activate key targets including TP53 AKT1 and BCL2 to alleviate mitochondrial dysfunction and regulate macrophage polarization thereby improving AS The 10 active compounds of BYHWD including 5hydroxyLtryptophan zwitterion and Isoliquiritigenin played an important role in regulating macrophages polarization to alleviate AS Copyright  2024 Published by Elsevier BV DOI 101016jjep2024119152 PMID 39580134 Conflict of interest statement Declaration of

the overall effects of HBsAg on liver tissues from HBV transgenic mice proteome interactome and signal pathway analysis were employed to uncover the underlying mechanisms Bioinformatics analysis of 191 differentially expressed proteins suggested that HBV upregulated the expression of multiple enzymes involved in lipid synthesis and small HBs SHBs caused lipid accumulation in cells Further studies showed that SHBs bound to binding immunoglobulin protein Bip which normally functions in cell homeostasis against the unfolded protein response UPR signaling via occupying inositolrequiring enzyme 1 IRE1 Hijacking Bip by SHBs alleviated the inhibition of postendoplasmic reticulum ER signaling and sequential activation of the IRE1 downstream transcription factors involved in lipid synthesis such as spliced Xbox binding protein 1 sXBP1 and sterol regulatory elementbinding protein 1 SREBP1 leading to lipid metabolism disorder The restoration of Bip can alleviate ER stress and block the sequential postER signaling caused by SHBs This study revealed a new pathway through which SHBs promote lipid disorder and suggests that Bip may serve as a novel target for intervention in HBV related liver diseases SIGNIFICANCE In this study we found a new pathway promoting the lipid disorder by SHBs through quantitative proteomics studies and Bip may serve as a novel target for

a central pathogenic factor Urolithin B UB a product of ellagitannins has recently been assigned diverse pharmacological activities due to its potent antioxidant and antiinflammatory properties Therefore the current study explored the potential renoprotective effect of UB on 5FUinduced nephrotoxicity in mice and illuminated its potential mechanistic pathways In this study administration of UB 50 and 100 mgkg mitigated 5FUinduced elevated levels of kidney injury indices including renal somatic index serum creatinine blood urea nitrogen and serum cystatin C that were concurrent with

thiosulfinate is an abundant bioactive compound in garlic Allium sativum L with broadspectrum antiinflammatory antifungal antioxidant and antitumor properties The bioactive compounds of garlic including allicin may also help reduce the incidence of various diseases although the individual contributions and precise mechanisms are still largely unknown In this study we reveal that allicin and the closely related compounds diallyl disulfide and diallyl trisulfide all containing more than one disulfide bond protect mouse hippocampal HT22 cells against chemically induced ferroptosis a newly defined form of cell death characterized by irondependent lipid peroxidation In contrast these organosulfur compounds did not prevent chemically induced apoptosis The antiferroptotic efficacies of

endothelial cells VECs The lack of robust disease models for VMs impedes drug discovery Here we devise a robust protocol for the generation of human induced VECs iVECs through manipulation of cellcycle dynamics via the retinoic signaling pathway We introduce an L914F mutation into the TIE2 gene locus of induced pluripotent stem cells iPSCs and show that the mutated iVECs form dilated blood

experimental methods that are laborintensive and timeconsuming computational methods for drugtarget interactions prediction are more popular in recent years Conventional computational methods almost simply view heterogeneous network constructed by the drugrelated and proteinrelated dataset instead of comprehensively exploring drugprotein pair DPP information To address this limitation we proposed a Double Multiview Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network framework for drugtarget interaction prediction DMHGNN In DMHGNN one multiview heterogeneous graph neural network is based on metapaths and denoising autoencoder for protein drugrelated heterogeneous network learning and another multiview heterogeneous graph neural network is based on multichannel graph convolutional network for drugprotein pair similarity network learning First a metapathbased graph encoder with the attention mechanism is used for substructure learning of complex relationships from heterogeneous network constructed by proteins drugs sideeffects and diseases obtaining key information that is easy to be ignored in global learning of heterogeneous networks and multisource neighbouring features for drugs and proteins are learned from heterogeneous network via denoising autoencoder model Then multiview graphs of drugprotein pairs DPPs including the topology graph semantics graph and collaborative graph with shared weights are constructed and the multichannel graph convolutional network GCN is utilized to learn the deep representation of DPPs Finally a multilayer fully connection network is trained to predict drugtarget interactions Experiments have demonstrated its effectiveness and better performance than stateoftheart methods Copyright  2024 Elsevier BV All rights reserved DOI

cyclindependent kinase CDK family that is actively involved in transcription regulation and RNA splicing CDK13 binds with its partner cyclin K to regulate several biological processes CDK13 and cyclin K complex phosphorylates RNA pol II carboxylterminal domain CTD at several serine residues creating transcription elongation The upregulation of the kinase contributes to tumor growth and cell proliferation and is highly associated with various cancers including skin stomach and ovarian Thus it can be considered an efficient therapeutic target for the development of drugs against cancer In this work a virtual high throughput screening vHTS of the ZINC library was carried out to elucidate the initial potent compounds Further filters were applied to identify the hit compounds among the 90000 compound library Based on the docking scores and binding affinity the top 100 hits were elucidated and they were further narrowed down to 50 compounds based on ADMET and Lipinskis RO5 filter Finally 10 compounds were chosen that showed appreciable biological activity Among them ZINC02136558 was selected as a potent lead compound that showed strong interaction with the amino acid residues of active and binding sites of CDK13 Furthermore the allatom molecular dynamic simulation was performed at 200 ns to explore the dynamic evolution of the system Finally the results showed that the

caused by viruses are challenging to contain as their outbreak and spread could be very sudden compounded by rapid mutations making the development of drugs and vaccines a continued endeavour that requires fast discovery and preparedness Targeting viral infections with small molecules remains one of the treatment options to reduce transmission and the disease burden A lesson learned from the recent coronavirus disease COVID19 is to collect readytoscreen small molecule libraries in preparation for the next viral outbreak and potentially find a clinical candidate before it becomes a pandemic Public availability of diverse compound libraries well annotated in terms of chemical structures and scaffolds modes of action and bioactivities are therefore crucial to ensure the participation of academic laboratories in these screening efforts especially in resourcelimited settings where synthesis testing and computing capacity are scarce Here we demonstrate a lowresource approach to populate the chemical space of naturally occurring and synthetic small molecules that have shown in vitro andor in vivo activities against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 and its target proteins We have manually curated two datasets of small molecules naturally occurring and synthetically derived by reading and collecting handcurating the published literature Information from the literature reveals that a majority of the reported SARSCoV2 compounds act by inhibiting the main protease while 25 of the compounds currently have no known target Scaffold analysis and principal component analysis revealed that the most common scaffolds in the datasets are quite distinct We then expanded the initially manually curated dataset of over 1200 compounds via an ultralarge scale 2D and 3D similarity search obtaining an expanded collection of over 150 k purchasable compounds The spanned chemical space significantly extends beyond that of a commercially available coronavirus library of more than 20 k small molecules and constitutes a good starting collection for virtual screening campaigns given its manageable size and proximity to

4Department of Biotechnology and Biomedicine Technical University of Denmark Lyngby Denmark mibtibiodtudk BACKGROUND Permafrost microbiomes are of paramount importance for the biogeochemistry of high latitude soils and while endemic biosynthetic domain sequences involved in secondary metabolism have been found in polar surface soils the biosynthetic potential of permafrost microbiomes remains unexplored Moreover the nature of these ecosystems facilitates the unique opportunity to study the distribution and diversity of biosynthetic genes in relic DNA from ancient microbiomes To explore the biosynthesis potential in permafrost we used adenylation AD domain sequencing to evaluate nonribosomal peptide NRP production in permafrost cores housing microbiomes separated at kilometer and kiloyear scales RESULTS Permafrost microbiomes represented NRP repertoires significantly different from that of temperate soil microbiomes but as for temperate soils the estimated domain richness and diversity was strongly correlated to the bacterial taxonomic diversity across locations Furthermore we found significant differences in both community composition and AD domain composition across geographical and temporal distances Overall the vast majority of biosynthetic domains showed below 90 amino acid similarity to characterized BGCs confirming the high degree of novelty of NRPs inherent to permafrost microbiomes Using available metagenomic sequences we further identified a high biosynthetic diversity beyond NRPs throughout arctic surface soils down to deep and ancient megayear old permafrost microbiomes CONCLUSION We have shown that arctic permafrost microbiomes harbor a unique biosynthetic repertoire rich in hitherto undescribed NRPs This diversity is driven by geographic separation across kilometer scales and by the bacterial taxonomic diversity between microbiomes confined in separate permafrost layers Hence the permafrost biome represents a unique resource for studying secondary metabolism and potentially for the discovery of novel drug leads  2024 The Authors DOI 101186s40793024006448 PMID 39578925 Conflict of interest statement Declarations Ethics

investigation is needed to identify therapeutic targets and better understand its mechanisms In this study we aimed to identify drug targets and explore the relationships between gene expression protein levels and migraine pathophysiology METHODS We utilized cispQTL data from deCODE Genetics combined with migraine GWAS data from the GERA  UKB cohort as the discovery cohort and the FinnGen R10 cohort as the replication cohort SMR and MR analyses identified migraineassociated protein loci Brain eQTL data from GTEx v8 and BrainMeta v2 were used to explore causal relationships between gene expression protein levels and migraine risk Mediation analysis assessed the role of metabolites and PheWAS evaluated potential side effects RESULTS Four loci were identified PNKP MRVI1 CALCB and INPP5B PNKP and MRVI1 showed a high level of evidence and opposing effects at the gene and protein levels PNKP gene expression in certain brain regions was protective against migraine while its plasma protein levels were positively associated with migraine risk MRVI1 showed protective effects at the protein level but had the opposite effect at the gene expression level Mediation analysis revealed that the glutamate to pyruvate ratio and 3CMPFP mediated PNKPs effects on migraine PheWAS indicated associations between PNKP and body composition traits suggesting drug safety considerations CONCLUSION PNKP and MRVI1 exhibit dual mechanisms of action at the gene and protein levels potentially involving distinct mechanistic pathways Among them PNKP emerges as a promising drug target for

identifying hit molecules from a large collection of potential druglike candidates rely on biophysical theory to compute approximations to the Gibbs free energy of the binding interaction between the drug and its protein target These approaches have a significant limitation in that they require exceptional computing capabilities for even relatively small collections of molecules Increasingly large and complex stateoftheart deep learning approaches have gained popularity with the promise to improve the productivity of drug design notorious for its numerous failures However as deep learning models increase in their size and complexity their acceleration at the hardware level becomes more challenging Hyperdimensional Computing HDC has recently gained attention in the computer hardware community due to its algorithmic simplicity relative to deep learning approaches The HDC learning paradigm which represents data with highdimension binary vectors allows the use of lowprecision binary vector arithmetic to create models of the data that can be learned without the need for the gradientbased optimization required in many conventional machine learning and deep learning methods This algorithmic simplicity allows for acceleration in hardware that has been previously demonstrated in a range of application areas computer vision bioinformatics mass spectrometery remote sensing edge devices etc To the best of our knowledge our work is the first to consider HDC for the task of fast and efficient screening of modern druglike compound libraries We also propose the first HDC graphbased encoding methods for molecular data demonstrating consistent and substantial improvement over previous work We compare our approaches to alternative approaches on the wellstudied

transfer occurring within and between species playing a pivotal role in this diversification Nevertheless most studies focus on clinical and farm animal isolates and research on the pangenome dynamics of Salmonella isolates from retail stage of the animal food supply chain is limited Here we investigated the genomes of 950 Salmonella isolates recovered from retail chicken and pork meats in seven provinces and one municipality of China in 2018 We observed a strong correlation between Salmonella sublineage diversity and the accessory genome with meat type revealing reduced diversity associated with increased resistance Importantly genes associated with antibiotic biocide and heavy metal resistance were unevenly distributed in Salmonella from retail chicken and pork Pork Salmonella isolates showed a higher prevalence of copper and silver resistance genes while chicken Salmonella isolates displayed a significant predominance of genetic determinants associated with cephalosporin and ciprofloxacin resistance Moreover cooccurrence patterns of resistance determinants and their interaction with mobile genetic elements also correlated with meat type In summary our findings shed light

prospects for accelerating drug discovery by identifying potential drugdisease associations DDAs for existing drugs and diseases Previous methods have generated metapathaugmented node or graph embeddings for DDA prediction in drugdisease heterogeneous networks However these approaches rarely develop endtoend frameworks for path instancelevel representation learning as well as the further feature selection and aggregation By leveraging the abundant topological information in path instances more finegrained and interpretable predictions can be achieved To this end we introduce deep multiple instance learning into drug repositioning by proposing a novel method called MilGNet MilGNet employs a heterogeneous graph neural network HGNNbased encoder to learn drug and disease node embeddings Treating each drugdisease pair as a bag we designed a special quadruplet metapath form and implemented a pseudo metapath generator in MilGNet to obtain multiple metapath instances based on network topology Additionally a bidirectional instance encoder enhances the representation of metapath instances Finally MilGNet utilizes a multiscale interpretable predictor to aggregate bag embeddings with an attention mechanism providing predictions at both the bag and instance levels for accurate and explainable predictions Comprehensive experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate that MilGNet significantly outperforms ten advanced methods Notably three case studies on one drug Methotrexate and two diseases Renal Failure and Mismatch Repair Cancer Syndrome highlight MilGNets

the most widely used nanomaterials mesoporous silica nanoparticles MSNs have received extensive attraction due to their desirable physicochemical performances of high stability large surface area and tunable pore sizes Besides the US Food and Drug Administration FDA has recognized that silicabased nanoparticles are generally safe for biomedical applications However the poor biodegradation and inert SiOSi framework of inorganic MSNs severely impair their diverse biomedical applications A promising strategy to improve the physicochemical properties of MSNs is the incorporation of functional organic moieties into their framework to construct mesoporous organosilica nanoparticles MONs which exhibit distinct advantages over traditional inorganic MSNs such as adjustable organosilica framework excellent biocompatibility stimuliresponsive biodegradability and even improved therapeutic effects Moreover the emerging hollowstructured MONs HMONs with an internal cavity can offer a large drug loading capacity and thus become increasingly attractive and promising theranostic nanoplatforms in biomedicine In recent years numerous studies have delved into establishing multifunctional HMONs with sizes ranging in diameters from 50 to 200 nm for desirable biological responses With the gradual deepening of research smallsized HMONs with diameters below 50 nm sub50 nm HMONs demonstrate unparalleled advantages in extending blood circulation time reducing the risk of vascular occlusion and achieving high tumor accumulation thus leading to a growing interest in the design development and translation of sub50 nm HMONs However the mechanism of the chemical synthesis and structural regulation of sub50 nm HMONs is still unclear which is detrimental to further

challenges of HMONs in clinic trials as well as provide a comprehensive outlook on the future development of sub50 nm HMONs These innovative sub50 nm HMONs hold the potential to introduce novel

Disruption of the outwardopen OO DAT conformation or its stabilization in the inwardopen IO conformation recapitulates substrate effects on DAT endocytosis Amphetamine strongly increases PKCdependent endocytosis of norepinephrine transporter NET but not of serotonin transporter SERT correlating with a substantially weaker ubiquitination of SERT compared to NET We propose a shapetransition model

OBJECTIVE This study aimed to investigate the mechanism of action of Jiedu Yizhi formula JDYZF in the treatment of Alzheimers disease AD through network pharmacology molecular docking technology and in vivo experiments METHOD The main active ingredients of seven herbs in the Chinese Medicine compound JDYZF were identified by searching the TCMSP database PubChem database CNKI and other sources Disease targets of AD were obtained from databases such as OMIM TDD DisGeNET and DrugBank A proteinprotein interaction PPI network was constructed using the STRING platform and core targets were identified through topological analysis using Cytoscape software Gene Ontology GO functional analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of the relevant targets were performed using the Metascape database The main active ingredients of JDYZF and potential core targets were identified based on degree values Molecular docking technology was used to verify the interactions between the main active ingredients and potential core targets Furthermore water maze tests and hematoxylineosin HE staining of brain and liver tissues were performed to evaluate the effects of JDYZF on cognitive dysfunction in AD mice and neuronal damage in hippocampal brain tissue and to assess drug toxicity PCR was performed to determine the expression levels of the apoptosisrelated genes Bcl2 Bax and caspase3 and to investigate the effect of JDYZF on hippocampal apoptosis in AD mice Results One hundred twelve core PPI target proteins including CASP3 TP53 and VEGFA were found between JDYZF and AD The KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed significant enrichment of the MAPK signaling pathway PI3KAKT signaling pathway and so on Water maze tests revealed that the highdose JDYZF treatment significantly improved the escape latency of AD model mice The HE staining results showed that JDYZF exerted a protective effect on neuronal damage in the hippocampus of AD mice JDYZF could upregulate the expression of the antiapoptotic factor Bcl2 while downregulating the expression of the proapoptotic factors Bax and caspase3 Conclusion JDYZF can improve the

Protein 25 SNAP25 as a candidate target molecule receptor for CES Several results supported the identification of SNAP25 as the CES receptor IVinjected FAMCES colocalized with SNAP25 in the tumors and direct binding studies showed specific binding of the CES peptide to recombinant human SNAP25 A CES peptidedrug conjugate designed for photodynamic therapy showed selective cytotoxicity to SNAP25 glioblastoma cell lines Specific accumulation of systemically injected antiSNAP25 antibody in U87MG glioblastoma and labeling of intact U87MG cells with antiSNAP in flow cytometry showed that SNAP25 is available from the circulation but not in normal tissues and that it is present at the cell surface Using an array of ECM proteins and surface plasmon resonance revealed that SNAP25 binds moderately to collagen V and strongly to collagen VI Modeling studies suggested that CES and collagen VI compete for the same binding site on SNAP25 Our results introduce CES as a valuable targeting peptide for drug delivery and its receptor SNAP25 as a possible molecular marker of interest for glioblastoma DOI 101021acsmolpharmaceut4c00958 PMID 39575977", "1 Zh Nevrol Psikhiatr Im S S Korsakova

publisher Khalilov VS12 Kislyakov AN3 Kuznetsova AA34 Ryleva OA5 Kholin AA2 Zavadenko NN2 Author information 1Federal Research and Clinical Center for Children and Adolescents Moscow Russia 2Pirogov

National Medical Research Center for Neurosurgery Moscow Russia The article reports the discovery of pathological substrates with an atypical histopathological phenotype in the brains of patients undergoing surgery for drugresistant structural epilepsy A complete panel of histopathological staining and immunohistochemical analysis with a wide range of antibodies were available at pathological examination In addition to pathomorphological verification molecular genetic testing was performed for the presence of mutations in the BRAF genes at codon 600 and BRAFKIAA1549 MRI was performed at 30 Tl tomography using a standard protocol and an epileptic scanning protocol During pathomorphological examination the patients showed mixed signs of ganglioglioma CNS WHO grade 1 and focal cortical dysplasia type IIb This mixed combination of pathological processes in one substrate has not yet been described in publicly available sources and does not fit the definition of double pathology when they can coexist next door but have clear differentiation On MRI the pathological substrates were localized in the frontal and temporal lobes did not demonstrate typical radiological criteria of a tumor had a transmantle distribution from the the lateral ventricles to the cortex with local and regional smoothing of the graywhite demarcation and uneven thickening of the cortical plate in the area of interest In one case large calcification associated with cavitation of the white matter was found in the structure of the pathological substrate In another case the substrate showed decreased blood flow in the substrate structure on perfusion maps The described epileptogenic substrates differ markedly from classical gangliogliomas with two cell pools according to pathomorphological molecular genetic and radiological criteria The published results may indicate a completely new subgroup of gangliogliomas with cellular atypia or a previously unknown combination of two pathological processes or argue in favor of a common origin of neuronalglial tumors and FCD These data require prospective verification on a larger cohort of patients and an indepth study of the molecular genetic profile of the described pathological substrates in order to reliably verify their origin Publisher \u0412 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0435

Kennedy Center Vanderbilt University Medical Center Nashville TN USA Schizophrenia is a complex disease involving the dysregulation of numerous brain circuits and patients exhibit positive symptoms hallucinations delusions negative symptoms anhedonia and cognitive impairments We have shown that the antipsychotic efficacy of positive allosteric modulators PAMs of both the M4 muscarinic receptor and metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 mGlu1 involve the retrograde activation of the presynaptic cannabinoid type2 CB2 receptor indicating that CB2 activation or potentiation could result in a novel therapeutic strategy for schizophrenia We used two complementary assays receptormediated phosphoinositide hydrolysis and GIRK channel activation to characterize a CB2 PAM scaffold represented by the compound EC21a to explore its potential as a starting point to optimize therapeutics for schizophrenia These studies revealed that EC21a acts as an allosteric inverse agonist at CB2 in both assays and exhibits a mixed allosteric agonistnegative allosteric modulator profile at CB1 depending upon the assay used for profiling A series of compounds related to EC21a also functioned as CB2 inverse agonists Overall these results suggest that EC21a exhibits complicated and potentially assaydependent pharmacology which may impact interpretation of in vivo studies DOI 1010801079989320242431986 PMID

key Accurate technologies are available for Alzheimers disease AD but no platform can measure all the established and emerging biomarkers in one run The NUcleic acid Linked ImmunoSandwich Assay NULISA is a technology that requires 15 \u00b5L of sample to measure more than 100 analytes METHODS We compared ADrelevant biomarkers included in the NULISA against validated assays in cerebrospinal fluid CSF and plasma RESULTS CSF measures of amyloid beta 4240 and phosphorylated tau ptau217 are highly correlated when measured by immunoassay mass spectrometry or NULISA In plasma ptau217 performance is similar to that reported with other technologies when predicting amyloidosis Other biomarkers show a wide range of correlation values depending on the fluid and the platform DISCUSSION The NULISA multiplexed platform produces reliable results for established biomarkers in CSF that are useful in research settings with the advantage of measuring additional biomarkers using minimal sample volume

Medicines School of Traditional Chinese Pharmacy China Pharmaceutical University Nanjing 210009 Peoples Republic of China Bromodomaincontaining protein 4 BRD4 is the most promising target for the treatment of triplenegative breast cancer TNBC However its inherent resistant and acquired drug resistance limits its potential clinical application Recently it has been shown that cyclindependent kinases 46 CDK46 inhibitors can reincrease the sensitivity of TNBC cells to BRD4 inhibitors by combination therapy so we designed a series of dual target CDK6BRD4 inhibitors Among the newly synthesized compounds BC13 exhibited potent inhibitory activity against CDK6 and BRD4 It also displayed potent antiproliferative activity against TNBC cells In vivo experiments showed that BC13 has potent antitumor activity in the MDAMB231 xenograft mouse model without observable side effects BC13 demonstrates profound synergistic antitumor effects with ferroptosis inducer in TNBC cells Therefore BC13 is a novel dual inhibitor of CDK6BRD4 for the treatment of TNBC either as a single agent or in combination with RSL3 DOI 101021acsjmedchem4c01976 PMID 39575863", "1 J Drug Target 2024

associated with agerelated diseases such as Alzheimers disease Lipids are implicated in cellular senescence Fatty acids particularly eicosanoids have been associated with various forms of senescence and inflammation and the associated reactive oxygen species production has been proposed as a therapeutic target for mitigating senescence When overactivated calciumdependent phospholipase A2 cPLA2 catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid into eicosanoids such as leukotrienes and prostaglandins Recent Advances With a growing understanding of the importance of lipids as mediators and modulators of senescence cPLA2 has emerged as a compelling drug target cPLA2 overactivation plays a significant role in several pathways associated with senescence including neuroinflammation and oxidative stress Critical Issues Previous cPLA2 inhibitors have shown potential in ameliorating inflammation and oxidative stress but the dominant hurdles in the central nervous systemtargeting drug discovery are specificity and bloodbrain barrier penetrance Future Directions With the need for more effective drugs against neurological diseases we emphasize the significance of discovering new

Guangzhou 510006 P R China Lipidmediated phase separation is crucial for the formation of lipophilic spontaneous domain to regulate lipid metabolism and homeostasis furtherly contributing to multiple cell death pathways Herein a series of RuII lipidmimics based on short chains or midchain lipids are developed Among them RuLipM with two dodecyl chains significantly induces natural lipid phase separation via hydrocarbon chainmelting phase transitions Accompanied by the aggregation of RuLipMlabeled lipophilic membraneless compartments most polyunsaturated lipids are increased and the autophagic flux is retarded with the adaptor protein sequestosome 1 p62 Upon lowdose irradiation RuLipM further drives ferritinophagy providing an additional source of labile iron and rendering cells more sensitive to ferroptosis Meanwhile the peroxidation of polyunsaturated lipids occurs due to the deactivation of glutathione peroxidase 4 GPX4 and the overexpression of acylCoA synthetase longchain family member 4 ACSL4 leading to the immunogenic ferroptosis Ultimately both innate and adaptive immunity are invigorated indicating the tremendous antitumor capability of RuLipM in vivo This study presents an unprecedented discovery of small molecules capable of inducing and monitoring lipid phase separation thereby eliciting robust immune responses in living cells It provides a

Changchun China BACKGROUND To explore new modulatory intervention targets for radiationinduced lung injury bioinformatics analysis technology was used to search for the core driving genes in the pathogenesis of radiation pneumonitis and the results were verified by a radiationinduced murine lung injury model to find possible new targets for the treatment of radiation lung injury METHOD Gene Expression Omnibus Database was used to identify differentially expressed genes in radiation pneumonitis DAVID database was used for gene ontology GO and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome KEGG enrichment analysis Gene Set Enrichment Analysis was used to analyze abnormal expressions Proteinprotein interaction networks were constructed using STRING and Cytoscape Discovery Studio 45 software was used to find the preferred inhibitor of the specific gene A radiationinduced lung injury model was induced in female C57BL6N mice The specific inhibitors were administered by intraperitoneal injection 24 h before and for 7 consecutive days after radiation Lungs were harvested for further analysis 14 days and 10 weeks postirradiation RESULTS We screened Syk as one of the most important driver genes of radiation pneumonitis by bioinformatics analysis and screened the preferred Syk inhibitor fostamatinib from the drug database Syk was highly expressed in irradiated lung tissue and fostamatinib inhibited the level of Syk expression Syk inhibitor significantly alleviated the radiationinduced lung injury and downregulated the increased expression of p38 MAPK p53 IL1\u03b2 and IL6 in lung tissue at 2 weeks after radiation The levels of TGF\u03b2 COL1A1 and \u03b1SMA and degree of pulmonary fibrosis at 10 weeks after radiation were also decreased by Syk inhibitor CONCLUSION Syk

McClune CJ Liu JC Wick C De La Pe\u00f1a R Lange BM Fordyce PM Sattely ES Plants make complex and potent therapeutic molecules but difficulties in sourcing from natural producers or chemical synthesis

production but it has eluded discovery despite a half century of intensive research Within the search space of Taxus large enzymerich genome we suspected the complex paclitaxel pathway would be difficult to resolve using conventional gene coexpression analysis and small sample sets To improve the resolution of gene set identification we developed a multiplexed perturbation strategy to transcriptionally profile cell states spanning tissues cell types developmental stages and elicitation conditions This approach revealed a set of paclitaxel biosynthetic genes that segregate into expression modules that suggest consecutive biosynthetic subpathways These modules resolved seven new genes that when combined with previously known enzymes are sufficient for the de novo biosynthesis and isolation of baccatin III an industrial precursor for Taxol in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves at levels comparable to the natural abundance in Taxus needles Included are taxane 1\u03b2hydroxylase

method provides a solution to the longstanding challenge of the regioselective synthesis of substituted naphthalenes by cycloaddition Mechanistic studies show that this reaction occurs through a sequential process involving the formation of key palladacycle by a sequential CCCH bond activation and highly regioselective alkyne insertion enabled by cluster catalysis Wide substrate scope for both carboxylic acids and terminal alkynes is demonstrated with high functional group tolerance Moreover this reaction is scalable and applicable to the synthesis of functionalized molecules featuring bioactive fragments This reaction advances the toolbox of redoxneutral carboxylic acid interconversion to cycloaddition processes We anticipate that this approach will find broad application in

and contributes to global economic losses Commercial fungicides may provide temporary relief however their overuse resulted in adverse environmental consequences as well as led to drugresistant strains of T deformans Therefore the discovery of novel drug targets for the future synthesis of antifungal drugs against Taphrina deformans is needed Here we studied Taphrina deformans by computational proteomics approaches The whole genome and proteome of T deformans were subjected to subtractive proteomics highthroughput virtual screening and molecular dynamic simulations We employed subtractive proteomics analysis of 4659 proteins extracted from UniProtKB database after filtering out homologous and nonessential proteins we identified 189 essential ones including nine that participated in the crucial metabolic pathways of the pathogen These proteins were categorized as nuclear n  116 cytoplasmic n  37 and membrane n  36 Of those essential proteins glutamatecysteine ligase GCL emerged as one promising target due to its essential function for glutathione biosynthesis process which facilitates T deformans survival and pathogenicity To validate GCL as an antifungal target virtual screening and molecular docking studies with various commercial fungicides were carried out to better characterize GCL as a drug target The data showed strong binding affinities for polyoxin D fluoxastrobin trifloxystrobin and azoxystrobin within the active site of GCL Polyoxin D showed a strong affinity when the measured docking score was at 734 kcalmol while molecular dynamics simulations confirmed stable interactions three hydrogen bonds two hydrophobic bonds and one salt bridge interaction supporting our findings that GCL represents an excellent target for antifungal drug

covalent DNAencoded libraries to discover innovative triazinebased covalent inhibitors for the 3chymotrypsinlike protease 3CLpro Nsp5 and the papainlike protease PLpro domains of Nsp3 as well as novel nonnucleoside covalent inhibitors for the nonstructural protein 12 Nsp12 RdRp Optimization through molecular docking and medicinal chemistry led to the development of LU9 a nonpeptide 3CLpro inhibitor with an IC50 of 034 \u03bcM and LU10 whose crystal structure showed a distinct binding mode within the 3CLpro active site The Xray cocrystal structure of SARSCoV2 PLpro in complex with XD5 uncovered a previously unexplored binding site adjacent to the catalytic pocket Additionally a nonnucleoside covalent Nsp12 inhibitor XJ5 achieved a potency of 012 \u03bcM following comprehensive

disease modeling and drug discovery Therapies based on induced pluripotent stem cells iPSCs particularly stand out for their ability to differentiate into various cell types while avoiding ethical concerns However the development and application of these therapies are influenced by varying regulatory frameworks across countries This study provides a comparative analysis of regulations and research on stem cell therapies in key regions The European Union EU Switzerland South Korea Japan and the United States First the study reviews the regulatory frameworks on stem cell therapies The EU and Switzerland maintain rigorous guidelines that prioritize safety and ethical considerations which can hinder innovation In contrast the United States adopts a more flexible regulatory stance facilitating the rapid development of stem cell therapies South Korea and Japan take a balanced approach by incorporating practices from both regimes These regulatory differences reflect each countrys unique priorities and impact the pace and scope of stem cell therapy development Moreover the study examines global trends in clinical trials on stem cell treatments based on data obtained from two sources ClinicalTrialsgov and ICTRP Findings indicate a significant growth in the number of clinical trials since 2008 particularly in that involving iPSCs Therapeutic studies involving iPSCs predominantly target conditions affecting the cardiovascular and nervous systems which are considered vital The results put emphasis on the safety of stem cell treatments Meanwhile the number of such trials also varies by country The United States and Japan where relatively flexible guidelines on stem cell research are adopted are in a leading position However countries in the EU fall behind with rigorous regulations imposed This reflects the need for more flexible regulatory guidance for active development of stem cell therapies The findings underscore the importance of legal frameworks in facilitating innovation while ensuring safety Regulatory agencies in different countries should collaborate to achieve a balanced global standard to ensure the safe and efficient advancement of stem cell therapies Global regulatory convergence will promote international collaboration in research and the applicability of new treatments  2024 The Authors DOI 101186s13287024040659 PMCID PMC11583560

activity relationship QSAR systems which are knowledgebased and statisticsbased because of their low positive prediction values PPVs Previous studies have suggested that PAAs are metabolized into genotoxic nitrenium ions Moreover ddE a relativeenergy based index derived from quantum chemistry calculations that measures the stability nitrenium ions has been correlated with mutagenicity This study aims to further examine the ability of the ddEbased approach in improving QSAR mutagenicity predictions for PAAs and to develop a refined method to decrease false positive predictions RESULTS Information on 1177 PAAs was collected of which 420 were from public databases and 757 were from inhouse databases across 16 laboratories The total dataset included 465 Ames testpositive and 712 testnegative chemicals For internal PAAs detailed Ames test data were scrutinized and final decisions were made using common evaluation criteria In this study ddE calculations were performed using a convenient and consistent protocol An optimal ddE cutoff value of 5 kcalmol combined with a molecular weight  500 and ortho substitution groups yielded wellbalanced prediction scores sensitivity of 720 specificity of 759 PPV of 656 negative predictive value of 809 and a balanced accuracy of 740 The PPV of the ddEbased approach was greatly reduced by the presence of two ortho substituent groups of ethyl or larger as because almost all of them were negative in the Ames test regardless of their ddE values probably due to steric hindrance affecting interactions between the PAA and metabolic enzymes The great majority of the PAAs whose molecular weights were greater than 500 were also negative in Ames test despite ddE predictions indicating positive mutagenicity CONCLUSIONS This study proposes a refined approach to enhance the accuracy of QSAR mutagenicity predictions for PAAs by minimizing false positives This integrative approach incorporating molecular weight ortho substitution patterns and ddE values substantially can provide a more reliable basis for evaluating the genotoxic potential of PAAs  2024 The Authors DOI 101186s41021024003184 PMCID PMC11580225 PMID 39574188

Sciences Nanjing University Nanjing 210023 P R China Background Genetic mutations that cause the inactivation or aberrant activation of essential proteins may trigger alterations or even dysfunctions in cellular signaling pathways culminating in the development of precancerous lesions and cancer Mutations and such dysfunctions can result in the generation of novel proteins that are not part of the conventional human proteome Identification of these proteins carries a profound potential for unraveling promising drug targets and designing innovative therapeutic models Despite the emergence of diverse tools for detecting DNA or RNA variants facilitated by the widespread adoption of nucleotide sequencing technology these methods primarily target point mutations and exhibit suboptimal performance in detecting largescale and combinatorial mutations Additionally the outcomes of these tools are confined to the genome and transcriptome levels and do not provide the corresponding protein information resulting from genetic alterations Results We present the development of Sequencing Analysis Kit SAKit a bioinformatics pipeline for hybrid sequencing analysis integrating longread and shortread RNA sequencing data Long reads are utilized for detecting largescale variations such as gene fusions exon skipping intron retention and aberrant expression in noncoding regions owing to their excellent coverage capabilities Short reads serve to validate these findings at breakpoints and splice junctions Conversely short reads are employed for identifying smallscale variations including single nucleotide variants deletions and insertions due to their superior sequencing depth with long reads providing additional validation SAKit is designed to perform analyses using interspecies configuration files comprising genome references and annotation data making it applicable to both human and mouse studies Furthermore SAKit implements a hierarchical filtering approach to eliminate lowconfidence variants and employs open reading frame ORF analysis to translate identified variants into protein sequences Conclusion SAKit is a robust and versatile bioinformatics tool designed for the comprehensive identification of both largescale and smallscale variants from RNAseq data facilitating the discovery of novel proteins This pipeline integrates analysis of longread and shortread sequencing data offering a powerful solution for researchers in genomics and transcriptomics SAKit is freely accessible and opensource available through GitHub httpsgithubcomtherarnaSAKit

the molecular mechanisms in hepatic insulin resistance is essential for early preventive treatments To elucidate changes in insulin signal transduction associated with hepatocellular resistance we employed a multilayered mass spectrometrybased proteomics approach focused on insulin receptor IR signaling at the interactome phosphoproteome and proteome levels in a longterm hyperinsulinemiainduced insulinresistant HepG2 cell line with a knockout of the insulinlike growth factor 1 receptor IGF1R KO The analysis revealed insulinstimulated recruitment of the PI3K complex in both insulinsensitive and resistant cells Phosphoproteomics showed attenuated signaling via the metabolic PI3KAKT pathway but sustained extracellular signalregulated kinase ERK activity in insulinresistant cells At the proteome level the ephrin typeA receptor 2 EphA2 showed an insulininduced increase in expression which occurred through the ERK signaling pathway and was concordantly independent of insulin resistance Induction of EphA2 by insulin was confirmed in additional cell lines and observed uniquely in cells with high IRtoIGF1R ratio The multilayered proteomics dataset provided insights into insulin signaling serving as a resource to generate and test hypotheses leading to an improved understanding of insulin resistance  2024 The Authors DOI 101038s41598024778175 PMCID PMC11582730 PMID 39572596

the adult mouse testis an organ divided into spermproducing seminiferous tubules and the surrounding testosteroneproducing interstitium We find that spermproducing cells within seminiferous tubules lack expression of key necroptotic mediators and thus are resistant to a pronecroptotic challenge By comparison coordinated expression of the necroptotic pathway occurs in the testicular interstitium rendering cells within this compartment especially the lysozymepositive macrophages vulnerable to necroptotic cell death We also uncover a nonnecroptotic role for MLKL in regulating testosterone levels Thus MLKL serves two roles in the mouse testes  one involving the canonical response of macrophages to necroptotic insult and the other a noncanonical function in male reproductive hormone

twostep carboxylation reaction Biotindependent carboxylases play an essential role in the metabolism of key biomolecules and therefore they are the subject of ongoing drug discovery efforts as well as of studies seeking to better characterize their structure and function It has been an ongoing challenge to obtain high yields of mammalian biotindependent carboxylases for in vitro experimentation these enzymes have not been successfully purified when recombinantly expressed from a bacterial expression host and only low yields of these recombinant vertebrate enzymes have been obtained through expression in cell culture systems Here we describe a revived protocol to isolate mitochondrial biotindependent carboxylases pyruvate carboxylase propionylCoA carboxylase and 3methylcrotonylCoA carboxylase from fresh pig liver This serves as an inexpensive and effective alternative to using a recombinant expression system This scalable protocol can be completed in less than 48 h and affords

and prediction of Alzheimers disease AD are increasingly pressing in the early stage of the disease because the biomarkertargeted therapies may be most effective Diagnosis of AD largely depends on the clinical symptoms of AD Currently cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers and neuroimaging techniques are considered for clinical detection and diagnosis However these clinical diagnosis results could provide indications of the middle andor late stages of AD rather than the early stage and another limitation is the complexity attached to limited access cost and perceived invasiveness Therefore the prediction of AD still poses immense challenges and the development of novel biomarkers is needed for early diagnosis and urgent intervention before the onset of obvious phenotypes of AD Bloodbased biomarkers may enable earlier diagnose and aid detection and prognosis for AD because various substances in the blood are vulnerable to AD pathophysiology The application of a systematic biological paradigm based on highthroughput techniques has demonstrated accurate alterations of molecular levels during AD onset processes such as protein levels and metabolite levels which may facilitate the identification of AD at an early stage Notably proteomics and metabolomics have been used to identify candidate biomarkers in blood for AD diagnosis This review summarizes data on potential bloodbased biomarkers identified by proteomics and metabolomics that are closest to clinical implementation and discusses the current challenges and the future work of bloodbased candidates to achieve the aim of early screening for AD We also provide an overview of early diagnosis drug target discovery and even promising therapeutic approaches for AD  2024 The Authors CNS Neuroscience  Therapeutics published

lipoylation at the Nterminus of the antimicrobial peptide I6 Compared to the parent peptide I6 lipopeptides exhibited selective antifungal efficacy in the presence of Na Among the variants tested C8I6 emerged as the most effective with an average effective concentration of 53 \u03bcM against 12 different fungal species C8I6 combated fungal infections by disrupting both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial membranes impairing the proton motive force generating reactive oxygen species and triggering apoptosis in fungal cells Importantly C8I6 exhibited minimal hemolysis and cytotoxicity while effectively inhibiting fungal biofilm formation In vivo experiments further validated the safety and therapeutic potential of C8I6 in treating fungal skin infections These findings underscore the significance of

receptor agonists in schizophrenia a field of intense research since a seminal publication by Patel and colleagues 2007 We summarize evidence about selective potent and safe agents with quantifiable CNS penetration that can be used to test hypotheses of mGlu2 receptors involvement in neuropsychiatric diseases We summarize lessons learned from previous programs that should be considered to maximize the probability of success when targeting orthosteric and allosteric enhancement of mGlu2 receptor function in schizophrenia and beyond First we propose expanding our focus beyond presynaptic mGlu2 receptor stimulation in schizophrenia to novel hypotheses and that the choice of a therapeutic indication no longer be dictated by commercial opportunity but following science as a driver Second evidence on internal validity of preclinical studies supporting efficacy claims in the mGlu2 field is very limited This gap will need to be closed when reviewing the rationale to reinitiate efforts in this field Third the pomaglumetad program was halted due to insufficient clinical efficacy partly because of the inability to identify a treatment responder population In preclinical studies effects

metalion chelation properties Among them hydroxamic acidcontaining compounds 7r and 7f exhibited the best inhibitor activity against acetylcholinesterase AChE and butyrylcholinesterase BuChE respectively with the corresponding IC50 values of 041 and 106 \u03bcM which were superior to those of rivastigmine IC50  526 202 \u03bcM respectively Moreover compounds 7r and 7f presented excellent

MyDispense is one of the virtual simulations that has already been established as a suitable alternative for live experiential education in the pharmacy curriculum However there are no structured validated questionnaires available to assess the students perception while integrating MyDispense with pharmacy practice experiential education Therefore the present study aimed to validate a structured questionnaire and use the questionnaire to assess the student perception of various pharmacy practice experiential education METHODS Content and construct validity procedure was used to validate the questionnaire Two hundred students consented to participate in validating the questionnaire The validated questionnaire assessed the students perception of integrating MyDispense with Introductory Pharmacy Practice Experience 2 IPPE2 and Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experience APPE courses The questionnaire was structured with four domains which were exercise instructor technical and communication Each domain carried five items therefore the whole questionnaire had 20 items that succeeded in content validity In the survey 121 fourthyear and 117 fifthyear PharmD students volunteered to convey their perception of integrating MyDispense with IPPE 2 and APPE respectively The survey was conducted before and after the MyDispense exam in both the courses RESULTS The Cronbachs \u03b1 and McDonalds \u03c9 coefficients were  08 in all four domains indicating that the items related to the four domains have good internal consistency In Exploratory Factor Analysis EFA two items were found to crossload in the exercise domain and removed Therefore the EFA proposes 18 items for the confirmatory factor analysis CFA In CFA five fit indices were found to be satisfactory and this indicates construct was good enough to assess the student perception In IPPE 2 the pretest response the students had significantly higher satisfaction p  005 with all five items related to the technical domain In APPE the students had a significantly p  005 higher perception of all the items related to the exercise and technical domain in the pretest compared to the posttest Therefore the students pretest feedback allowed the instructor to identify and make the necessary corrections in the exercises to improve the quality exercises CONCLUSION This study provides a validated 18item questionnaire to assess the student perception of integrating MyDispense in experiential education The integration of MyDispense in experiential education needs to be done carefully by assessing

neurodegenerative diseases is associated with neuronal cell loss and cognitive dysfunction Monoacylglycerol lipase MAGL is involved in neuroinflammation in the brain via the degradation of endocannabinoid 2arachidonoylglycerol to arachidonic acid a precursor of some eicosanoids therefore MAGL inhibitors are expected to have antiinflammatory effects We recently developed a reversible selective central nervous system penetrant and orally available MAGL inhibitor compound 4f Compound 4f 1 mgkg robustly increased 2arachidonoylglycerol levels and decreased arachidonic acid levels in the mouse brain To examine whether compound 4f can suppress neuroinflammation and neuronal cell loss kainic acid KAinjected mice were used as a neuroinflammation model in this study Compound 4f 1 mgkg significantly decreased the cytokine and chemokine expression levels and suppressed neuronal cell loss in the hippocampi of mice Compound 4f also ameliorated cognitive impairment in KAinjected mice The cannabinoid receptor 1 antagonist AM251 and cannabinoid receptor 2 antagonist AM630 partly blocked the neuroprotective effects of compound 4f in the hippocampi of KAinjected mice Gene expression

thousand years and is considered the oldest infectious disease that still exists The Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacillus was spread worldwide due to human migrations and there is archaeological evidence of spinal tuberculosis cases in Egyptian and Andean mummies as well as texts that attributed the disease to social factors before suspecting its infectious nature Throughout its history humans have dealt with this pathology by developing unusual and ineffective therapies leading to a significant increase in the diseases mortality In the past century the first antibiotics were introduced bringing hope to eradicate this disease However evolutionary pressure has led to the emergence of multidrugresistant strains Today the development of computational techniques such as artificial intelligence has given us new hope for generating drugs and potential immunomodulatory therapies However it is essential to remember that those who do not know their history are doomed to repeat it In this review we summarize the history of tuberculosis analyzing theories of its possible origin its discovery the creation of the first empirical treatments vaccines the emergence of new antibiotics and how the mycobacterium quickly develops resistance Publisher La tuberculosis es una enfermedad ancestral que ha acompa\u00f1ado a la humanidad por los \u00faltimos tres mil a\u00f1os y

Intelligence Hefei Comprehensive National Science Center Hefei 230026 Anhui China Identifying drugtarget interactions DTIs is essential for drug discovery and development Existing deep learning approaches to DTI prediction often employ powerful feature encoders to represent drugs and targets holistically which usually cause significant redundancy and noise by neglecting the restricted binding regions Furthermore many previous DTI networks ignore or simplify the complex intermolecular interaction process involving diverse binding types which significantly limits both predictive ability and interpretability We propose ReduMixDTI an endtoend model that addresses feature redundancy and explicitly captures complex local interactions for DTI prediction In this study drug and target features are encoded by using graph neural networks and convolutional neural networks respectively These features are refined from channel and spatial perspectives to enhance the representations The proposed attention mechanism explicitly models pairwise interactions between drug and target substructures improving the models understanding of binding processes In extensive comparisons with seven stateoftheart methods ReduMixDTI demonstrates superior performance across three benchmark data sets and external test sets reflecting realworld scenarios Additionally we perform comprehensive ablation studies and visualize protein attention weights to enhance the interpretability The results confirm that ReduMixDTI serves as a robust and interpretable model for reducing feature redundancy contributing to advances in DTI prediction DOI 101021acsjcim4c01554 PMID 39570771", "1 Nucleic Acid Ther 2024 Nov 21 doi 101089nat20240069 Online ahead of print It is Time to

apparent by the accelerating pace of successful programs using duplex RNAs and antisense oligonucleotides to target mRNA Why has progress been slow A clear understanding of how miRNAs function in mammalian cells is obscured by the fact that miRNAs can exert their effects through multiple complex mechanisms This gap in our knowledge has complicated progress in drug discovery Better insights

University of South Carolina School of Medicine Columbia South Carolina United States Obesity increases the risk for developing several cancers including colorectal cancer CRC and is associated with liver perturbations which likely impacts treatment tolerance 5 fluorouracil 5FU remains a first line treatment for CRC but efficacy is hampered by interpatient variable responsiveness and off target toxicities The current study examined the impact of dietinduced obesity DIO on 5FU cytopenia and efficacy using two established CRC models MC38 C57BL6 and C26 CD2F1 DIO increased tumor size in both MC38 and C26 DIO reduced liver dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase dpyd expression the enzyme that catalyzes 5FUs catabolism to become inactive in MC38 mice but not C26 5FU remained efficacious against early MC38 and C26 tumor growth however 5FUinduced tumor and liver immune cell death was exacerbated following 3 cycles of 5FU with MC38 DIO caused dramatic changes to liver Kupffer Cells KC wherein there were increased prometastatic immunosuppressive KCs in Obese Control and MC38 5FU however depleted these KCs and increased inflammatory KCs in both Lean and Obese MC38 DIO yielded a milder obesity phenotype in CD2F1 mice and 5FUinduced cytopenia was not different between Lean and Obese DIO increased total liver KCs however C26 tumors increased liver KCs which were normalized with 5FU treatment irrespective of DIO While 5FU remained efficacious in both models of CRC and did not reduce survival multiple cycles of 5FU monotherapy increased liver and tumor immune cell death in DIO

environmental risk factors Given the polygenic aspect of ASD targeting several genesproteins responsible for pathogenesis at once might prove advantageous in its remediation Various phytochemicals have been proven to possess neuroprotective antiinflammatory and antioxidant properties by alleviating symptoms and targeting a complex network of genesproteins related to disease pathology However the effects of many of these phytochemicals on ASD are enigmatic and their molecular targets and molecular mechanisms are still elusive Here we provide a comprehensive comparative study on the therapeutic potential of 6 phytochemicals viz Cannabidiol Crocetin Epigallocatechin3gallate Fisetin Quercetin and Resveratrol based on their neuroprotective properties in managing ASD We aimed to identify and target a network of core proteins in the pathology of ASD via phytochemicals using network pharmacology molecular docking and simulation studies The methodology includes screening genesproteins implicated in ASD as targets of each phytochemical followed by network construction using ProteinProtein Interactions Gene Ontology and enrichment analysis The constructed network was further narrowed down to the hub genes in the network followed by their spatiotemporal analysis molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation 6 core genes were obtained for ASD 3 of which are directly involved in disease pathogenesis The study provides a set of novel genes that phytochemicals can target to ameliorate and regulate ASD pathogenesis Cannabidiol can inhibit ABCG2 MAOB and PDE4B Resveratrol can target ABCB1 and Quercetin can regulate AKR1C4 and XDH This study demonstrated the potential of phytochemicals to target and regulate ABCG2 ABCB1 AKR1C4 MAOB PDE4B and XDH which

Japan BACKGROUND Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic drug used for chemotherapyinduced nausea and vomiting It is particularly effective in preventing delayed nausea and vomiting induced by highly emetogenic chemotherapy HEC However it has side effects such as hyperglycemia and somnolence the efficacy and safety of adding olanzapine to triplet antiemetic therapy 5HT3 receptor antagonist NK1 receptor antagonist and dexamethasone must be verified METHODS We performed a systematic review and metaanalysis to compare the effectiveness of olanzapine combined with triplet antiemetic therapy and triplet antiemetic therapy in preventing nausea and vomiting for HEC We set five items hyperglycemia prevention of vomiting prevention of nausea adverse events and cost drug costs as outcomes and conducted a systematic review RESULTS Five randomized controlled trials was extracted and they showed that the addition of olanzapine was effective in control of nausea and vomiting especially in the delayed phase Complete response of acute and delayed phase were significantly higher in the olanzapine group Risk difference was  014 95 CI  026  003 p  002 and  014 95 CI  019 009 p  000001 respectively Additionally we evaluated hyperglycemia and somnolence which are typical side effects of olanzapine However the incidence of grade  2 was low in both events and there was no significant difference between olanzapine and control groups CONCLUSIONS Adding olanzapine to triplet antiemetic therapy is useful in preventing nausea and vomiting induced by HEC and there would be minimal adverse effects from the combination use  2024 The Authors under exclusive licence to Japan Society of Clinical Oncology DOI 101007s10147024026634 PMID 39570460 Conflict of interest statement

2020000292hmceducn Type 2 diabetes mellitus T2DM is a metabolic disorder that is characterized by insulin resistance and hyperglycemia It is also known to be a risk factor for Alzheimers disease AD Insulin plays a crucial role in regulating the bodys metabolism and is responsible for activating the Phosphoinotide3Kinase PI3KProtein Kinase B Akt signaling pathway This pathway is activated when insulin binds to the insulin receptor on nerve cells and it helps regulate the metabolism of glucose and lipids Dysfunction in the insulin signaling pathway can lead to a decrease in brain insulin levels and insulin sensitivity thereby inducing disruptions in insulin signal transduction and leading to disorders in brain energy metabolism Moreover these dysfunctions also contribute to the accumulation of \u03b2amyloid A\u03b2 deposition and the hyperphosphorylation of Tau protein both of which are characteristic features of AD Therefore this article focuses on insulin resistance to reveal the complex mechanism between brain insulin resistance and AD occurrence in T2DM On this basis this article further summarizes the biological effects and mechanisms of antidiabetic drugs on the two diseases aiming to provide new ideas for the discovery of drugs for the treatment of T2DM combined with AD  2024 The Authors under exclusive licence to Springer ScienceBusiness Media LLC part of

view of the significance of both \u03b2lactam antibiotics and the production of one or more \u03b2lactamases as the major resistance mechanism especially in Gramnegative bacteria we implemented an original approach to selectively deliver antibacterial zidovudine AZT exploiting the \u03b2lactamasemediated hydrolysis of a \u03b2lactamconjugate prodrug The synthesis of the targeted pronucleosides was performed in 57 steps and based on an original Pdcatalyzed crosscoupling reaction Enzymatic and microbiological evaluations were performed to evaluate the synthesized pronucleosides yielding new insights into molecular recognition of \u03b2lactamase enzymes This approach would potentially allow a targeted and selective eradication of antibioticresistant \u03b2lactamaseproducing opportunistic pathogens as the inactive prodrug is unable to harm the commensal microbial flora DOI 101039d4ob01396d PMID 39569564", "1 Drug Dev Res 2024 Dec858e70022 doi 101002ddr70022 Design Synthesis and

cell growth However traditional methodologies for studying lactylation have predominantly relied on peptide enrichment from wholecell lysates which tend to favor the detection of highabundance peptides thus limiting the identification of lowabundance lactylated peptides To address this limitation here we employed subcellular fractionation to separate proteins and map lactylated peptides from each isolated subcellular fraction using a model cell line In brief we identified 1217 lysine lactylation Kla sites on 553 proteins across four subcellular fractions Subsequent pathway enrichment analysis revealed that Kla proteins participate in distinct pathways depending on the subcellular contexts In addition this subcellular fractionation method enabled the discovery of 36 previously unreported Kla proteins and 223 novel Kla sites many of which are present in low abundance Notably several proteins contain multiple newly identified Kla sites exemplified by the transcriptional regulator ATRX Furthermore our results indicate the possibility of PTM crosstalk between Kla and other PTMs such as ubiquitination and sumoylation In conclusion subcellular fractionation facilitates the identification of Kla proteins that have been previously uncovered and could be overlooked by affinity enrichment of wholecell lysates DOI 101021jasms4c00366 PMID 39569522", "1 iScience 2024 Oct

treatment of cancers with mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 that are deficient in homologous recombination The identification of modulators of PARP1 activity is critical to understand and overcome resistance to PARPis We integrated data from three omicsscale screens to discover new regulators of PARP1 activity We identified SART1 and show that its silencing leads to an increase in polyADP ribosylation and chromatinbound PARP1 SART1 is recruited to chromatin following DNA damage and limits PARP1 chromatin retention and activity The SART1 Nterminus is sufficient to regulate the accumulation of PAR chains and PARP1 on chromatin an activity dependent on the RGGRG box Silencing of SART1 leads to an increased sensitivity of cells to DNA damage induced by IR irrespective of BRCA1 status and to PARPis only in absence of BRCA1 These results suggest that SART1 could be clinically utilized to improve PARPi efficacy  2024 The Authors DOI 101016jisci2024111252 PMCID PMC11576398 PMID

and Life Sciences Argonne National Laboratory Lemont IL 60439 USA Molecular design based on generative models such as variational autoencoders VAEs has become increasingly popular in recent years due to its efficiency for exploring highdimensional molecular space to identify molecules with desired properties While the efficacy of the initial model strongly depends on the training data the sampling efficiency of the model for suggesting novel molecules with enhanced properties can be further enhanced via latent space optimization LSO In this paper we propose a multiobjective LSO method that can significantly enhance the performance of generative molecular design GMD The proposed method adopts an iterative weighted retraining approach where the respective weights of the molecules in the training data are determined by their Pareto efficiency We demonstrate that our multiobjective GMD LSO method can significantly improve the performance of GMD for jointly optimizing multiple molecular
