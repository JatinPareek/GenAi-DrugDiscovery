cation channel and overexpression of 2E led to the generation of a distinct type of large extracellular vesicles 2EEVs Although 2EEVs have been demonstrated to facilitate viral transmission in a receptorindependent way the characteristics and biogenesis mechanism remain enigmatic Via lipidomics and proteomic analysis we found 2EEVs are distinct from endosomederived exosomes 2EEVs are notably enriched in Golgi apparatus components aligning with the observed fragmentation in Golgi morphology Through live cell imaging we established a connection between 2EEVs formation Golgi fragmentation

Nucleocytoplasmatic transport plays an essential role in eukaryotic cell homeostasis and is mediated by karyopherins Importin \u03b21 KPNB1 and its adaptor protein importin \u03b11 KPNA2 are the bestcharacterized karyopherins that effect nuclear import Here we identify a novel smallmolecule inhibitor of the importin \u03b21mediated nuclear import We design a reporter cell line by stably tagging endogenous importin \u03b11 with a fluorescent protein to screen for compounds affecting its subcellular localization We identify a series of compounds that trigger cytoplasmatic accumulation of importin \u03b11 The lead compound ibetazol is further characterized in a broad sequence of cellular nuclear transport assays Ibetazol is shown to inhibit all importin \u03b21mediated nuclear import quickly and specifically without affecting transport mediated by other karyopherins Detailed molecular mechanism of action studies demonstrate that ibetazol inhibits importin \u03b21 by covalently targeting Cys585 In summary ibetazol is a novel small molecule inhibitor of importin \u03b21 enabling pharmacological inhibition of the importin \u03b21mediated nuclear import process with

Currently all FDAapproved antiviral drugs against SARSCoV2 are RdRp or 3CLpro inhibitors However the mutations causing drug resistance have been observed in RdRp and 3CLpro from SARSCoV2 which makes it necessary to develop antivirals with novel mechanisms Through the application of a structurebased drug design SBDD approach we discover a series of novel potent noncovalent PLpro inhibitors with remarkable in vitro potency and in vivo PK properties The cocrystal structures of PLpro with lead compounds reveal that the residues D164 and Q269 around the S2 site are critical for improving the inhibitors potency The lead compound GZNLP36 not only inhibits SARSCoV2 and its variants at the cellular level with EC50 ranging from 582 nM to 3062 nM but also inhibits HCoVNL63 and HCoV229E with EC50 of 816 nM and 266 \u03bcM respectively Oral administration of the GZNLP36 results in significantly improved survival and notable reductions in lung viral loads and lesions in SARSCoV2 infection

Cholecystokinin CCK and gastrin are gastrointestinal hormones traditionally recognised for their roles in digestion However it has been recognised that these hormones may also modulate immune function Here we examine the immunemodulating effects of CCK and gastrin and explore the functional significance of this dual role In addition to the direct effect of these hormones on immune cell function we discuss why hormones that regulate complex physiological and behavioural aspects of digestion might also influence immune responses Notably recent findings highlight the importance of these hormones in promoting a tolerogenic hepatic environment particularly as the liver encounters gutderived inflammogens following a meal Additionally the neuroimmune crosstalk mediated by CCK suggests that this hormone may influence immune responses indirectly via the gutbrain axis especially in the context of infection or inflammation Furthermore the role of CCK in inducing feeding cessation and satiety appears to be repurposed during sickness behaviour such as the loss of appetite during infection Collectively these observations suggest that nutritional strategies including permissive underfeeding or fasting could have important clinical implications A deeper understanding of the dual roles of CCK and gastrin in digestion and immunity may pave the way for novel therapeutic approaches that

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE Buyang Huanwu Decoction BYHWD a traditional prescription known for its Supplementing Qi and Promoting Blood Circulation has demonstrated noteworthy therapeutic roles in regulating macrophage polarization to atherosclerosis AS However its underlying mechanisms remain unknown AIM OF THE STUDY The purpose of this paper was to decipher mechanism of BYHWD in regulating macrophage polarization to alleviate AS MATERIALS AND METHODS A comprehensive virtual screening strategy incorporating network pharmacology and batch molecular docking combined with experimental validation techniques was employed to systematically elucidate the underlying mechanism of BYHWD regulating macrophage polarization to alleviate AS RESULTS Firstly based on highfat diet induced AS model in apolipoprotein Edeficient mice it was found that BYHWD can significantly regulate macrophage polarization to alleviate AS Then the network pharmacological analysis revealed that the core targets of BYHWD regulating macrophage polarization to alleviate AS mainly involved TP53 AKT1 and BCL2 The mitochondrial function and metabolism were the main biological processes Meanwhile the main chemical components were identified as 3Opcoumaroylquinic acid Dmandelonitrile Ellagic acid Ferulic acid 5hydroxyLtryptophan zwitterion Isoliquiritigenin SenkyunolideF Anofinic acid Trimethylhydroquinone and SenkyunolideE by batch molecular docking strategy Further the in vitro experiments demonstrated that BYHWD not only regulated macrophage polarization and alleviated macrophage foam formation but also modulated mitochondrial function and the expression of TP53 pAKT and BCL2 proteins Finally multivariate statistical analysis confirmed that the ameliorative effect of BYHWD on AS was closely related to mitochondrial function and macrophage polarization regulated by TP53 AKT1 and BCL2 CONCLUSIONS BYHWD could activate key targets including TP53 AKT1 and BCL2 to alleviate mitochondrial dysfunction and regulate macrophage polarization thereby improving AS The 10 active compounds of BYHWD including 5hydroxyLtryptophan zwitterion and Isoliquiritigenin played an important role in regulating macrophages polarization to alleviate AS Copyright  2024 Published by Elsevier BV DOI 101016jjep2024119152 PMID 39580134 Conflict of interest statement Declaration of

the overall effects of HBsAg on liver tissues from HBV transgenic mice proteome interactome and signal pathway analysis were employed to uncover the underlying mechanisms Bioinformatics analysis of 191 differentially expressed proteins suggested that HBV upregulated the expression of multiple enzymes involved in lipid synthesis and small HBs SHBs caused lipid accumulation in cells Further studies showed that SHBs bound to binding immunoglobulin protein Bip which normally functions in cell homeostasis against the unfolded protein response UPR signaling via occupying inositolrequiring enzyme 1 IRE1 Hijacking Bip by SHBs alleviated the inhibition of postendoplasmic reticulum ER signaling and sequential activation of the IRE1 downstream transcription factors involved in lipid synthesis such as spliced Xbox binding protein 1 sXBP1 and sterol regulatory elementbinding protein 1 SREBP1 leading to lipid metabolism disorder The restoration of Bip can alleviate ER stress and block the sequential postER signaling caused by SHBs This study revealed a new pathway through which SHBs promote lipid disorder and suggests that Bip may serve as a novel target for intervention in HBV related liver diseases SIGNIFICANCE In this study we found a new pathway promoting the lipid disorder by SHBs through quantitative proteomics studies and Bip may serve as a novel target for

a central pathogenic factor Urolithin B UB a product of ellagitannins has recently been assigned diverse pharmacological activities due to its potent antioxidant and antiinflammatory properties Therefore the current study explored the potential renoprotective effect of UB on 5FUinduced nephrotoxicity in mice and illuminated its potential mechanistic pathways In this study administration of UB 50 and 100 mgkg mitigated 5FUinduced elevated levels of kidney injury indices including renal somatic index serum creatinine blood urea nitrogen and serum cystatin C that were concurrent with

thiosulfinate is an abundant bioactive compound in garlic Allium sativum L with broadspectrum antiinflammatory antifungal antioxidant and antitumor properties The bioactive compounds of garlic including allicin may also help reduce the incidence of various diseases although the individual contributions and precise mechanisms are still largely unknown In this study we reveal that allicin and the closely related compounds diallyl disulfide and diallyl trisulfide all containing more than one disulfide bond protect mouse hippocampal HT22 cells against chemically induced ferroptosis a newly defined form of cell death characterized by irondependent lipid peroxidation In contrast these organosulfur compounds did not prevent chemically induced apoptosis The antiferroptotic efficacies of

endothelial cells VECs The lack of robust disease models for VMs impedes drug discovery Here we devise a robust protocol for the generation of human induced VECs iVECs through manipulation of cellcycle dynamics via the retinoic signaling pathway We introduce an L914F mutation into the TIE2 gene locus of induced pluripotent stem cells iPSCs and show that the mutated iVECs form dilated blood

experimental methods that are laborintensive and timeconsuming computational methods for drugtarget interactions prediction are more popular in recent years Conventional computational methods almost simply view heterogeneous network constructed by the drugrelated and proteinrelated dataset instead of comprehensively exploring drugprotein pair DPP information To address this limitation we proposed a Double Multiview Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network framework for drugtarget interaction prediction DMHGNN In DMHGNN one multiview heterogeneous graph neural network is based on metapaths and denoising autoencoder for protein drugrelated heterogeneous network learning and another multiview heterogeneous graph neural network is based on multichannel graph convolutional network for drugprotein pair similarity network learning First a metapathbased graph encoder with the attention mechanism is used for substructure learning of complex relationships from heterogeneous network constructed by proteins drugs sideeffects and diseases obtaining key information that is easy to be ignored in global learning of heterogeneous networks and multisource neighbouring features for drugs and proteins are learned from heterogeneous network via denoising autoencoder model Then multiview graphs of drugprotein pairs DPPs including the topology graph semantics graph and collaborative graph with shared weights are constructed and the multichannel graph convolutional network GCN is utilized to learn the deep representation of DPPs Finally a multilayer fully connection network is trained to predict drugtarget interactions Experiments have demonstrated its effectiveness and better performance than stateoftheart methods Copyright  2024 Elsevier BV All rights reserved DOI

cyclindependent kinase CDK family that is actively involved in transcription regulation and RNA splicing CDK13 binds with its partner cyclin K to regulate several biological processes CDK13 and cyclin K complex phosphorylates RNA pol II carboxylterminal domain CTD at several serine residues creating transcription elongation The upregulation of the kinase contributes to tumor growth and cell proliferation and is highly associated with various cancers including skin stomach and ovarian Thus it can be considered an efficient therapeutic target for the development of drugs against cancer In this work a virtual high throughput screening vHTS of the ZINC library was carried out to elucidate the initial potent compounds Further filters were applied to identify the hit compounds among the 90000 compound library Based on the docking scores and binding affinity the top 100 hits were elucidated and they were further narrowed down to 50 compounds based on ADMET and Lipinskis RO5 filter Finally 10 compounds were chosen that showed appreciable biological activity Among them ZINC02136558 was selected as a potent lead compound that showed strong interaction with the amino acid residues of active and binding sites of CDK13 Furthermore the allatom molecular dynamic simulation was performed at 200 ns to explore the dynamic evolution of the system Finally the results showed that the

caused by viruses are challenging to contain as their outbreak and spread could be very sudden compounded by rapid mutations making the development of drugs and vaccines a continued endeavour that requires fast discovery and preparedness Targeting viral infections with small molecules remains one of the treatment options to reduce transmission and the disease burden A lesson learned from the recent coronavirus disease COVID19 is to collect readytoscreen small molecule libraries in preparation for the next viral outbreak and potentially find a clinical candidate before it becomes a pandemic Public availability of diverse compound libraries well annotated in terms of chemical structures and scaffolds modes of action and bioactivities are therefore crucial to ensure the participation of academic laboratories in these screening efforts especially in resourcelimited settings where synthesis testing and computing capacity are scarce Here we demonstrate a lowresource approach to populate the chemical space of naturally occurring and synthetic small molecules that have shown in vitro andor in vivo activities against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2 and its target proteins We have manually curated two datasets of small molecules naturally occurring and synthetically derived by reading and collecting handcurating the published literature Information from the literature reveals that a majority of the reported SARSCoV2 compounds act by inhibiting the main protease while 25 of the compounds currently have no known target Scaffold analysis and principal component analysis revealed that the most common scaffolds in the datasets are quite distinct We then expanded the initially manually curated dataset of over 1200 compounds via an ultralarge scale 2D and 3D similarity search obtaining an expanded collection of over 150 k purchasable compounds The spanned chemical space significantly extends beyond that of a commercially available coronavirus library of more than 20 k small molecules and constitutes a good starting collection for virtual screening campaigns given its manageable size and proximity to

4Department of Biotechnology and Biomedicine Technical University of Denmark Lyngby Denmark mibtibiodtudk BACKGROUND Permafrost microbiomes are of paramount importance for the biogeochemistry of high latitude soils and while endemic biosynthetic domain sequences involved in secondary metabolism have been found in polar surface soils the biosynthetic potential of permafrost microbiomes remains unexplored Moreover the nature of these ecosystems facilitates the unique opportunity to study the distribution and diversity of biosynthetic genes in relic DNA from ancient microbiomes To explore the biosynthesis potential in permafrost we used adenylation AD domain sequencing to evaluate nonribosomal peptide NRP production in permafrost cores housing microbiomes separated at kilometer and kiloyear scales RESULTS Permafrost microbiomes represented NRP repertoires significantly different from that of temperate soil microbiomes but as for temperate soils the estimated domain richness and diversity was strongly correlated to the bacterial taxonomic diversity across locations Furthermore we found significant differences in both community composition and AD domain composition across geographical and temporal distances Overall the vast majority of biosynthetic domains showed below 90 amino acid similarity to characterized BGCs confirming the high degree of novelty of NRPs inherent to permafrost microbiomes Using available metagenomic sequences we further identified a high biosynthetic diversity beyond NRPs throughout arctic surface soils down to deep and ancient megayear old permafrost microbiomes CONCLUSION We have shown that arctic permafrost microbiomes harbor a unique biosynthetic repertoire rich in hitherto undescribed NRPs This diversity is driven by geographic separation across kilometer scales and by the bacterial taxonomic diversity between microbiomes confined in separate permafrost layers Hence the permafrost biome represents a unique resource for studying secondary metabolism and potentially for the discovery of novel drug leads  2024 The Authors DOI 101186s40793024006448 PMID 39578925 Conflict of interest statement Declarations Ethics

investigation is needed to identify therapeutic targets and better understand its mechanisms In this study we aimed to identify drug targets and explore the relationships between gene expression protein levels and migraine pathophysiology METHODS We utilized cispQTL data from deCODE Genetics combined with migraine GWAS data from the GERA  UKB cohort as the discovery cohort and the FinnGen R10 cohort as the replication cohort SMR and MR analyses identified migraineassociated protein loci Brain eQTL data from GTEx v8 and BrainMeta v2 were used to explore causal relationships between gene expression protein levels and migraine risk Mediation analysis assessed the role of metabolites and PheWAS evaluated potential side effects RESULTS Four loci were identified PNKP MRVI1 CALCB and INPP5B PNKP and MRVI1 showed a high level of evidence and opposing effects at the gene and protein levels PNKP gene expression in certain brain regions was protective against migraine while its plasma protein levels were positively associated with migraine risk MRVI1 showed protective effects at the protein level but had the opposite effect at the gene expression level Mediation analysis revealed that the glutamate to pyruvate ratio and 3CMPFP mediated PNKPs effects on migraine PheWAS indicated associations between PNKP and body composition traits suggesting drug safety considerations CONCLUSION PNKP and MRVI1 exhibit dual mechanisms of action at the gene and protein levels potentially involving distinct mechanistic pathways Among them PNKP emerges as a promising drug target for

identifying hit molecules from a large collection of potential druglike candidates rely on biophysical theory to compute approximations to the Gibbs free energy of the binding interaction between the drug and its protein target These approaches have a significant limitation in that they require exceptional computing capabilities for even relatively small collections of molecules Increasingly large and complex stateoftheart deep learning approaches have gained popularity with the promise to improve the productivity of drug design notorious for its numerous failures However as deep learning models increase in their size and complexity their acceleration at the hardware level becomes more challenging Hyperdimensional Computing HDC has recently gained attention in the computer hardware community due to its algorithmic simplicity relative to deep learning approaches The HDC learning paradigm which represents data with highdimension binary vectors allows the use of lowprecision binary vector arithmetic to create models of the data that can be learned without the need for the gradientbased optimization required in many conventional machine learning and deep learning methods This algorithmic simplicity allows for acceleration in hardware that has been previously demonstrated in a range of application areas computer vision bioinformatics mass spectrometery remote sensing edge devices etc To the best of our knowledge our work is the first to consider HDC for the task of fast and efficient screening of modern druglike compound libraries We also propose the first HDC graphbased encoding methods for molecular data demonstrating consistent and substantial improvement over previous work We compare our approaches to alternative approaches on the wellstudied

transfer occurring within and between species playing a pivotal role in this diversification Nevertheless most studies focus on clinical and farm animal isolates and research on the pangenome dynamics of Salmonella isolates from retail stage of the animal food supply chain is limited Here we investigated the genomes of 950 Salmonella isolates recovered from retail chicken and pork meats in seven provinces and one municipality of China in 2018 We observed a strong correlation between Salmonella sublineage diversity and the accessory genome with meat type revealing reduced diversity associated with increased resistance Importantly genes associated with antibiotic biocide and heavy metal resistance were unevenly distributed in Salmonella from retail chicken and pork Pork Salmonella isolates showed a higher prevalence of copper and silver resistance genes while chicken Salmonella isolates displayed a significant predominance of genetic determinants associated with cephalosporin and ciprofloxacin resistance Moreover cooccurrence patterns of resistance determinants and their interaction with mobile genetic elements also correlated with meat type In summary our findings shed light

prospects for accelerating drug discovery by identifying potential drugdisease associations DDAs for existing drugs and diseases Previous methods have generated metapathaugmented node or graph embeddings for DDA prediction in drugdisease heterogeneous networks However these approaches rarely develop endtoend frameworks for path instancelevel representation learning as well as the further feature selection and aggregation By leveraging the abundant topological information in path instances more finegrained and interpretable predictions can be achieved To this end we introduce deep multiple instance learning into drug repositioning by proposing a novel method called MilGNet MilGNet employs a heterogeneous graph neural network HGNNbased encoder to learn drug and disease node embeddings Treating each drugdisease pair as a bag we designed a special quadruplet metapath form and implemented a pseudo metapath generator in MilGNet to obtain multiple metapath instances based on network topology Additionally a bidirectional instance encoder enhances the representation of metapath instances Finally MilGNet utilizes a multiscale interpretable predictor to aggregate bag embeddings with an attention mechanism providing predictions at both the bag and instance levels for accurate and explainable predictions Comprehensive experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate that MilGNet significantly outperforms ten advanced methods Notably three case studies on one drug Methotrexate and two diseases Renal Failure and Mismatch Repair Cancer Syndrome highlight MilGNets

the most widely used nanomaterials mesoporous silica nanoparticles MSNs have received extensive attraction due to their desirable physicochemical performances of high stability large surface area and tunable pore sizes Besides the US Food and Drug Administration FDA has recognized that silicabased nanoparticles are generally safe for biomedical applications However the poor biodegradation and inert SiOSi framework of inorganic MSNs severely impair their diverse biomedical applications A promising strategy to improve the physicochemical properties of MSNs is the incorporation of functional organic moieties into their framework to construct mesoporous organosilica nanoparticles MONs which exhibit distinct advantages over traditional inorganic MSNs such as adjustable organosilica framework excellent biocompatibility stimuliresponsive biodegradability and even improved therapeutic effects Moreover the emerging hollowstructured MONs HMONs with an internal cavity can offer a large drug loading capacity and thus become increasingly attractive and promising theranostic nanoplatforms in biomedicine In recent years numerous studies have delved into establishing multifunctional HMONs with sizes ranging in diameters from 50 to 200 nm for desirable biological responses With the gradual deepening of research smallsized HMONs with diameters below 50 nm sub50 nm HMONs demonstrate unparalleled advantages in extending blood circulation time reducing the risk of vascular occlusion and achieving high tumor accumulation thus leading to a growing interest in the design development and translation of sub50 nm HMONs However the mechanism of the chemical synthesis and structural regulation of sub50 nm HMONs is still unclear which is detrimental to further

challenges of HMONs in clinic trials as well as provide a comprehensive outlook on the future development of sub50 nm HMONs These innovative sub50 nm HMONs hold the potential to introduce novel

Disruption of the outwardopen OO DAT conformation or its stabilization in the inwardopen IO conformation recapitulates substrate effects on DAT endocytosis Amphetamine strongly increases PKCdependent endocytosis of norepinephrine transporter NET but not of serotonin transporter SERT correlating with a substantially weaker ubiquitination of SERT compared to NET We propose a shapetransition model

OBJECTIVE This study aimed to investigate the mechanism of action of Jiedu Yizhi formula JDYZF in the treatment of Alzheimers disease AD through network pharmacology molecular docking technology and in vivo experiments METHOD The main active ingredients of seven herbs in the Chinese Medicine compound JDYZF were identified by searching the TCMSP database PubChem database CNKI and other sources Disease targets of AD were obtained from databases such as OMIM TDD DisGeNET and DrugBank A proteinprotein interaction PPI network was constructed using the STRING platform and core targets were identified through topological analysis using Cytoscape software Gene Ontology GO functional analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of the relevant targets were performed using the Metascape database The main active ingredients of JDYZF and potential core targets were identified based on degree values Molecular docking technology was used to verify the interactions between the main active ingredients and potential core targets Furthermore water maze tests and hematoxylineosin HE staining of brain and liver tissues were performed to evaluate the effects of JDYZF on cognitive dysfunction in AD mice and neuronal damage in hippocampal brain tissue and to assess drug toxicity PCR was performed to determine the expression levels of the apoptosisrelated genes Bcl2 Bax and caspase3 and to investigate the effect of JDYZF on hippocampal apoptosis in AD mice Results One hundred twelve core PPI target proteins including CASP3 TP53 and VEGFA were found between JDYZF and AD The KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed significant enrichment of the MAPK signaling pathway PI3KAKT signaling pathway and so on Water maze tests revealed that the highdose JDYZF treatment significantly improved the escape latency of AD model mice The HE staining results showed that JDYZF exerted a protective effect on neuronal damage in the hippocampus of AD mice JDYZF could upregulate the expression of the antiapoptotic factor Bcl2 while downregulating the expression of the proapoptotic factors Bax and caspase3 Conclusion JDYZF can improve the

Protein 25 SNAP25 as a candidate target molecule receptor for CES Several results supported the identification of SNAP25 as the CES receptor IVinjected FAMCES colocalized with SNAP25 in the tumors and direct binding studies showed specific binding of the CES peptide to recombinant human SNAP25 A CES peptidedrug conjugate designed for photodynamic therapy showed selective cytotoxicity to SNAP25 glioblastoma cell lines Specific accumulation of systemically injected antiSNAP25 antibody in U87MG glioblastoma and labeling of intact U87MG cells with antiSNAP in flow cytometry showed that SNAP25 is available from the circulation but not in normal tissues and that it is present at the cell surface Using an array of ECM proteins and surface plasmon resonance revealed that SNAP25 binds moderately to collagen V and strongly to collagen VI Modeling studies suggested that CES and collagen VI compete for the same binding site on SNAP25 Our results introduce CES as a valuable targeting peptide for drug delivery and its receptor SNAP25 as a possible molecular marker of interest for glioblastoma DOI 101021acsmolpharmaceut4c00958 PMID 39575977", "1 Zh Nevrol Psikhiatr Im S S Korsakova

publisher Khalilov VS12 Kislyakov AN3 Kuznetsova AA34 Ryleva OA5 Kholin AA2 Zavadenko NN2 Author information 1Federal Research and Clinical Center for Children and Adolescents Moscow Russia 2Pirogov

National Medical Research Center for Neurosurgery Moscow Russia The article reports the discovery of pathological substrates with an atypical histopathological phenotype in the brains of patients undergoing surgery for drugresistant structural epilepsy A complete panel of histopathological staining and immunohistochemical analysis with a wide range of antibodies were available at pathological examination In addition to pathomorphological verification molecular genetic testing was performed for the presence of mutations in the BRAF genes at codon 600 and BRAFKIAA1549 MRI was performed at 30 Tl tomography using a standard protocol and an epileptic scanning protocol During pathomorphological examination the patients showed mixed signs of ganglioglioma CNS WHO grade 1 and focal cortical dysplasia type IIb This mixed combination of pathological processes in one substrate has not yet been described in publicly available sources and does not fit the definition of double pathology when they can coexist next door but have clear differentiation On MRI the pathological substrates were localized in the frontal and temporal lobes did not demonstrate typical radiological criteria of a tumor had a transmantle distribution from the the lateral ventricles to the cortex with local and regional smoothing of the graywhite demarcation and uneven thickening of the cortical plate in the area of interest In one case large calcification associated with cavitation of the white matter was found in the structure of the pathological substrate In another case the substrate showed decreased blood flow in the substrate structure on perfusion maps The described epileptogenic substrates differ markedly from classical gangliogliomas with two cell pools according to pathomorphological molecular genetic and radiological criteria The published results may indicate a completely new subgroup of gangliogliomas with cellular atypia or a previously unknown combination of two pathological processes or argue in favor of a common origin of neuronalglial tumors and FCD These data require prospective verification on a larger cohort of patients and an indepth study of the molecular genetic profile of the described pathological substrates in order to reliably verify their origin Publisher \u0412 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0435

Kennedy Center Vanderbilt University Medical Center Nashville TN USA Schizophrenia is a complex disease involving the dysregulation of numerous brain circuits and patients exhibit positive symptoms hallucinations delusions negative symptoms anhedonia and cognitive impairments We have shown that the antipsychotic efficacy of positive allosteric modulators PAMs of both the M4 muscarinic receptor and metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 mGlu1 involve the retrograde activation of the presynaptic cannabinoid type2 CB2 receptor indicating that CB2 activation or potentiation could result in a novel therapeutic strategy for schizophrenia We used two complementary assays receptormediated phosphoinositide hydrolysis and GIRK channel activation to characterize a CB2 PAM scaffold represented by the compound EC21a to explore its potential as a starting point to optimize therapeutics for schizophrenia These studies revealed that EC21a acts as an allosteric inverse agonist at CB2 in both assays and exhibits a mixed allosteric agonistnegative allosteric modulator profile at CB1 depending upon the assay used for profiling A series of compounds related to EC21a also functioned as CB2 inverse agonists Overall these results suggest that EC21a exhibits complicated and potentially assaydependent pharmacology which may impact interpretation of in vivo studies DOI 1010801079989320242431986 PMID

key Accurate technologies are available for Alzheimers disease AD but no platform can measure all the established and emerging biomarkers in one run The NUcleic acid Linked ImmunoSandwich Assay NULISA is a technology that requires 15 \u00b5L of sample to measure more than 100 analytes METHODS We compared ADrelevant biomarkers included in the NULISA against validated assays in cerebrospinal fluid CSF and plasma RESULTS CSF measures of amyloid beta 4240 and phosphorylated tau ptau217 are highly correlated when measured by immunoassay mass spectrometry or NULISA In plasma ptau217 performance is similar to that reported with other technologies when predicting amyloidosis Other biomarkers show a wide range of correlation values depending on the fluid and the platform DISCUSSION The NULISA multiplexed platform produces reliable results for established biomarkers in CSF that are useful in research settings with the advantage of measuring additional biomarkers using minimal sample volume

Medicines School of Traditional Chinese Pharmacy China Pharmaceutical University Nanjing 210009 Peoples Republic of China Bromodomaincontaining protein 4 BRD4 is the most promising target for the treatment of triplenegative breast cancer TNBC However its inherent resistant and acquired drug resistance limits its potential clinical application Recently it has been shown that cyclindependent kinases 46 CDK46 inhibitors can reincrease the sensitivity of TNBC cells to BRD4 inhibitors by combination therapy so we designed a series of dual target CDK6BRD4 inhibitors Among the newly synthesized compounds BC13 exhibited potent inhibitory activity against CDK6 and BRD4 It also displayed potent antiproliferative activity against TNBC cells In vivo experiments showed that BC13 has potent antitumor activity in the MDAMB231 xenograft mouse model without observable side effects BC13 demonstrates profound synergistic antitumor effects with ferroptosis inducer in TNBC cells Therefore BC13 is a novel dual inhibitor of CDK6BRD4 for the treatment of TNBC either as a single agent or in combination with RSL3 DOI 101021acsjmedchem4c01976 PMID 39575863", "1 J Drug Target 2024

associated with agerelated diseases such as Alzheimers disease Lipids are implicated in cellular senescence Fatty acids particularly eicosanoids have been associated with various forms of senescence and inflammation and the associated reactive oxygen species production has been proposed as a therapeutic target for mitigating senescence When overactivated calciumdependent phospholipase A2 cPLA2 catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid into eicosanoids such as leukotrienes and prostaglandins Recent Advances With a growing understanding of the importance of lipids as mediators and modulators of senescence cPLA2 has emerged as a compelling drug target cPLA2 overactivation plays a significant role in several pathways associated with senescence including neuroinflammation and oxidative stress Critical Issues Previous cPLA2 inhibitors have shown potential in ameliorating inflammation and oxidative stress but the dominant hurdles in the central nervous systemtargeting drug discovery are specificity and bloodbrain barrier penetrance Future Directions With the need for more effective drugs against neurological diseases we emphasize the significance of discovering new

Guangzhou 510006 P R China Lipidmediated phase separation is crucial for the formation of lipophilic spontaneous domain to regulate lipid metabolism and homeostasis furtherly contributing to multiple cell death pathways Herein a series of RuII lipidmimics based on short chains or midchain lipids are developed Among them RuLipM with two dodecyl chains significantly induces natural lipid phase separation via hydrocarbon chainmelting phase transitions Accompanied by the aggregation of RuLipMlabeled lipophilic membraneless compartments most polyunsaturated lipids are increased and the autophagic flux is retarded with the adaptor protein sequestosome 1 p62 Upon lowdose irradiation RuLipM further drives ferritinophagy providing an additional source of labile iron and rendering cells more sensitive to ferroptosis Meanwhile the peroxidation of polyunsaturated lipids occurs due to the deactivation of glutathione peroxidase 4 GPX4 and the overexpression of acylCoA synthetase longchain family member 4 ACSL4 leading to the immunogenic ferroptosis Ultimately both innate and adaptive immunity are invigorated indicating the tremendous antitumor capability of RuLipM in vivo This study presents an unprecedented discovery of small molecules capable of inducing and monitoring lipid phase separation thereby eliciting robust immune responses in living cells It provides a

Changchun China BACKGROUND To explore new modulatory intervention targets for radiationinduced lung injury bioinformatics analysis technology was used to search for the core driving genes in the pathogenesis of radiation pneumonitis and the results were verified by a radiationinduced murine lung injury model to find possible new targets for the treatment of radiation lung injury METHOD Gene Expression Omnibus Database was used to identify differentially expressed genes in radiation pneumonitis DAVID database was used for gene ontology GO and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome KEGG enrichment analysis Gene Set Enrichment Analysis was used to analyze abnormal expressions Proteinprotein interaction networks were constructed using STRING and Cytoscape Discovery Studio 45 software was used to find the preferred inhibitor of the specific gene A radiationinduced lung injury model was induced in female C57BL6N mice The specific inhibitors were administered by intraperitoneal injection 24 h before and for 7 consecutive days after radiation Lungs were harvested for further analysis 14 days and 10 weeks postirradiation RESULTS We screened Syk as one of the most important driver genes of radiation pneumonitis by bioinformatics analysis and screened the preferred Syk inhibitor fostamatinib from the drug database Syk was highly expressed in irradiated lung tissue and fostamatinib inhibited the level of Syk expression Syk inhibitor significantly alleviated the radiationinduced lung injury and downregulated the increased expression of p38 MAPK p53 IL1\u03b2 and IL6 in lung tissue at 2 weeks after radiation The levels of TGF\u03b2 COL1A1 and \u03b1SMA and degree of pulmonary fibrosis at 10 weeks after radiation were also decreased by Syk inhibitor CONCLUSION Syk

McClune CJ Liu JC Wick C De La Pe\u00f1a R Lange BM Fordyce PM Sattely ES Plants make complex and potent therapeutic molecules but difficulties in sourcing from natural producers or chemical synthesis

production but it has eluded discovery despite a half century of intensive research Within the search space of Taxus large enzymerich genome we suspected the complex paclitaxel pathway would be difficult to resolve using conventional gene coexpression analysis and small sample sets To improve the resolution of gene set identification we developed a multiplexed perturbation strategy to transcriptionally profile cell states spanning tissues cell types developmental stages and elicitation conditions This approach revealed a set of paclitaxel biosynthetic genes that segregate into expression modules that suggest consecutive biosynthetic subpathways These modules resolved seven new genes that when combined with previously known enzymes are sufficient for the de novo biosynthesis and isolation of baccatin III an industrial precursor for Taxol in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves at levels comparable to the natural abundance in Taxus needles Included are taxane 1\u03b2hydroxylase

method provides a solution to the longstanding challenge of the regioselective synthesis of substituted naphthalenes by cycloaddition Mechanistic studies show that this reaction occurs through a sequential process involving the formation of key palladacycle by a sequential CCCH bond activation and highly regioselective alkyne insertion enabled by cluster catalysis Wide substrate scope for both carboxylic acids and terminal alkynes is demonstrated with high functional group tolerance Moreover this reaction is scalable and applicable to the synthesis of functionalized molecules featuring bioactive fragments This reaction advances the toolbox of redoxneutral carboxylic acid interconversion to cycloaddition processes We anticipate that this approach will find broad application in

and contributes to global economic losses Commercial fungicides may provide temporary relief however their overuse resulted in adverse environmental consequences as well as led to drugresistant strains of T deformans Therefore the discovery of novel drug targets for the future synthesis of antifungal drugs against Taphrina deformans is needed Here we studied Taphrina deformans by computational proteomics approaches The whole genome and proteome of T deformans were subjected to subtractive proteomics highthroughput virtual screening and molecular dynamic simulations We employed subtractive proteomics analysis of 4659 proteins extracted from UniProtKB database after filtering out homologous and nonessential proteins we identified 189 essential ones including nine that participated in the crucial metabolic pathways of the pathogen These proteins were categorized as nuclear n  116 cytoplasmic n  37 and membrane n  36 Of those essential proteins glutamatecysteine ligase GCL emerged as one promising target due to its essential function for glutathione biosynthesis process which facilitates T deformans survival and pathogenicity To validate GCL as an antifungal target virtual screening and molecular docking studies with various commercial fungicides were carried out to better characterize GCL as a drug target The data showed strong binding affinities for polyoxin D fluoxastrobin trifloxystrobin and azoxystrobin within the active site of GCL Polyoxin D showed a strong affinity when the measured docking score was at 734 kcalmol while molecular dynamics simulations confirmed stable interactions three hydrogen bonds two hydrophobic bonds and one salt bridge interaction supporting our findings that GCL represents an excellent target for antifungal drug

covalent DNAencoded libraries to discover innovative triazinebased covalent inhibitors for the 3chymotrypsinlike protease 3CLpro Nsp5 and the papainlike protease PLpro domains of Nsp3 as well as novel nonnucleoside covalent inhibitors for the nonstructural protein 12 Nsp12 RdRp Optimization through molecular docking and medicinal chemistry led to the development of LU9 a nonpeptide 3CLpro inhibitor with an IC50 of 034 \u03bcM and LU10 whose crystal structure showed a distinct binding mode within the 3CLpro active site The Xray cocrystal structure of SARSCoV2 PLpro in complex with XD5 uncovered a previously unexplored binding site adjacent to the catalytic pocket Additionally a nonnucleoside covalent Nsp12 inhibitor XJ5 achieved a potency of 012 \u03bcM following comprehensive

disease modeling and drug discovery Therapies based on induced pluripotent stem cells iPSCs particularly stand out for their ability to differentiate into various cell types while avoiding ethical concerns However the development and application of these therapies are influenced by varying regulatory frameworks across countries This study provides a comparative analysis of regulations and research on stem cell therapies in key regions The European Union EU Switzerland South Korea Japan and the United States First the study reviews the regulatory frameworks on stem cell therapies The EU and Switzerland maintain rigorous guidelines that prioritize safety and ethical considerations which can hinder innovation In contrast the United States adopts a more flexible regulatory stance facilitating the rapid development of stem cell therapies South Korea and Japan take a balanced approach by incorporating practices from both regimes These regulatory differences reflect each countrys unique priorities and impact the pace and scope of stem cell therapy development Moreover the study examines global trends in clinical trials on stem cell treatments based on data obtained from two sources ClinicalTrialsgov and ICTRP Findings indicate a significant growth in the number of clinical trials since 2008 particularly in that involving iPSCs Therapeutic studies involving iPSCs predominantly target conditions affecting the cardiovascular and nervous systems which are considered vital The results put emphasis on the safety of stem cell treatments Meanwhile the number of such trials also varies by country The United States and Japan where relatively flexible guidelines on stem cell research are adopted are in a leading position However countries in the EU fall behind with rigorous regulations imposed This reflects the need for more flexible regulatory guidance for active development of stem cell therapies The findings underscore the importance of legal frameworks in facilitating innovation while ensuring safety Regulatory agencies in different countries should collaborate to achieve a balanced global standard to ensure the safe and efficient advancement of stem cell therapies Global regulatory convergence will promote international collaboration in research and the applicability of new treatments  2024 The Authors DOI 101186s13287024040659 PMCID PMC11583560

activity relationship QSAR systems which are knowledgebased and statisticsbased because of their low positive prediction values PPVs Previous studies have suggested that PAAs are metabolized into genotoxic nitrenium ions Moreover ddE a relativeenergy based index derived from quantum chemistry calculations that measures the stability nitrenium ions has been correlated with mutagenicity This study aims to further examine the ability of the ddEbased approach in improving QSAR mutagenicity predictions for PAAs and to develop a refined method to decrease false positive predictions RESULTS Information on 1177 PAAs was collected of which 420 were from public databases and 757 were from inhouse databases across 16 laboratories The total dataset included 465 Ames testpositive and 712 testnegative chemicals For internal PAAs detailed Ames test data were scrutinized and final decisions were made using common evaluation criteria In this study ddE calculations were performed using a convenient and consistent protocol An optimal ddE cutoff value of 5 kcalmol combined with a molecular weight  500 and ortho substitution groups yielded wellbalanced prediction scores sensitivity of 720 specificity of 759 PPV of 656 negative predictive value of 809 and a balanced accuracy of 740 The PPV of the ddEbased approach was greatly reduced by the presence of two ortho substituent groups of ethyl or larger as because almost all of them were negative in the Ames test regardless of their ddE values probably due to steric hindrance affecting interactions between the PAA and metabolic enzymes The great majority of the PAAs whose molecular weights were greater than 500 were also negative in Ames test despite ddE predictions indicating positive mutagenicity CONCLUSIONS This study proposes a refined approach to enhance the accuracy of QSAR mutagenicity predictions for PAAs by minimizing false positives This integrative approach incorporating molecular weight ortho substitution patterns and ddE values substantially can provide a more reliable basis for evaluating the genotoxic potential of PAAs  2024 The Authors DOI 101186s41021024003184 PMCID PMC11580225 PMID 39574188

Sciences Nanjing University Nanjing 210023 P R China Background Genetic mutations that cause the inactivation or aberrant activation of essential proteins may trigger alterations or even dysfunctions in cellular signaling pathways culminating in the development of precancerous lesions and cancer Mutations and such dysfunctions can result in the generation of novel proteins that are not part of the conventional human proteome Identification of these proteins carries a profound potential for unraveling promising drug targets and designing innovative therapeutic models Despite the emergence of diverse tools for detecting DNA or RNA variants facilitated by the widespread adoption of nucleotide sequencing technology these methods primarily target point mutations and exhibit suboptimal performance in detecting largescale and combinatorial mutations Additionally the outcomes of these tools are confined to the genome and transcriptome levels and do not provide the corresponding protein information resulting from genetic alterations Results We present the development of Sequencing Analysis Kit SAKit a bioinformatics pipeline for hybrid sequencing analysis integrating longread and shortread RNA sequencing data Long reads are utilized for detecting largescale variations such as gene fusions exon skipping intron retention and aberrant expression in noncoding regions owing to their excellent coverage capabilities Short reads serve to validate these findings at breakpoints and splice junctions Conversely short reads are employed for identifying smallscale variations including single nucleotide variants deletions and insertions due to their superior sequencing depth with long reads providing additional validation SAKit is designed to perform analyses using interspecies configuration files comprising genome references and annotation data making it applicable to both human and mouse studies Furthermore SAKit implements a hierarchical filtering approach to eliminate lowconfidence variants and employs open reading frame ORF analysis to translate identified variants into protein sequences Conclusion SAKit is a robust and versatile bioinformatics tool designed for the comprehensive identification of both largescale and smallscale variants from RNAseq data facilitating the discovery of novel proteins This pipeline integrates analysis of longread and shortread sequencing data offering a powerful solution for researchers in genomics and transcriptomics SAKit is freely accessible and opensource available through GitHub httpsgithubcomtherarnaSAKit

the molecular mechanisms in hepatic insulin resistance is essential for early preventive treatments To elucidate changes in insulin signal transduction associated with hepatocellular resistance we employed a multilayered mass spectrometrybased proteomics approach focused on insulin receptor IR signaling at the interactome phosphoproteome and proteome levels in a longterm hyperinsulinemiainduced insulinresistant HepG2 cell line with a knockout of the insulinlike growth factor 1 receptor IGF1R KO The analysis revealed insulinstimulated recruitment of the PI3K complex in both insulinsensitive and resistant cells Phosphoproteomics showed attenuated signaling via the metabolic PI3KAKT pathway but sustained extracellular signalregulated kinase ERK activity in insulinresistant cells At the proteome level the ephrin typeA receptor 2 EphA2 showed an insulininduced increase in expression which occurred through the ERK signaling pathway and was concordantly independent of insulin resistance Induction of EphA2 by insulin was confirmed in additional cell lines and observed uniquely in cells with high IRtoIGF1R ratio The multilayered proteomics dataset provided insights into insulin signaling serving as a resource to generate and test hypotheses leading to an improved understanding of insulin resistance  2024 The Authors DOI 101038s41598024778175 PMCID PMC11582730 PMID 39572596

the adult mouse testis an organ divided into spermproducing seminiferous tubules and the surrounding testosteroneproducing interstitium We find that spermproducing cells within seminiferous tubules lack expression of key necroptotic mediators and thus are resistant to a pronecroptotic challenge By comparison coordinated expression of the necroptotic pathway occurs in the testicular interstitium rendering cells within this compartment especially the lysozymepositive macrophages vulnerable to necroptotic cell death We also uncover a nonnecroptotic role for MLKL in regulating testosterone levels Thus MLKL serves two roles in the mouse testes  one involving the canonical response of macrophages to necroptotic insult and the other a noncanonical function in male reproductive hormone

twostep carboxylation reaction Biotindependent carboxylases play an essential role in the metabolism of key biomolecules and therefore they are the subject of ongoing drug discovery efforts as well as of studies seeking to better characterize their structure and function It has been an ongoing challenge to obtain high yields of mammalian biotindependent carboxylases for in vitro experimentation these enzymes have not been successfully purified when recombinantly expressed from a bacterial expression host and only low yields of these recombinant vertebrate enzymes have been obtained through expression in cell culture systems Here we describe a revived protocol to isolate mitochondrial biotindependent carboxylases pyruvate carboxylase propionylCoA carboxylase and 3methylcrotonylCoA carboxylase from fresh pig liver This serves as an inexpensive and effective alternative to using a recombinant expression system This scalable protocol can be completed in less than 48 h and affords

and prediction of Alzheimers disease AD are increasingly pressing in the early stage of the disease because the biomarkertargeted therapies may be most effective Diagnosis of AD largely depends on the clinical symptoms of AD Currently cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers and neuroimaging techniques are considered for clinical detection and diagnosis However these clinical diagnosis results could provide indications of the middle andor late stages of AD rather than the early stage and another limitation is the complexity attached to limited access cost and perceived invasiveness Therefore the prediction of AD still poses immense challenges and the development of novel biomarkers is needed for early diagnosis and urgent intervention before the onset of obvious phenotypes of AD Bloodbased biomarkers may enable earlier diagnose and aid detection and prognosis for AD because various substances in the blood are vulnerable to AD pathophysiology The application of a systematic biological paradigm based on highthroughput techniques has demonstrated accurate alterations of molecular levels during AD onset processes such as protein levels and metabolite levels which may facilitate the identification of AD at an early stage Notably proteomics and metabolomics have been used to identify candidate biomarkers in blood for AD diagnosis This review summarizes data on potential bloodbased biomarkers identified by proteomics and metabolomics that are closest to clinical implementation and discusses the current challenges and the future work of bloodbased candidates to achieve the aim of early screening for AD We also provide an overview of early diagnosis drug target discovery and even promising therapeutic approaches for AD  2024 The Authors CNS Neuroscience  Therapeutics published

lipoylation at the Nterminus of the antimicrobial peptide I6 Compared to the parent peptide I6 lipopeptides exhibited selective antifungal efficacy in the presence of Na Among the variants tested C8I6 emerged as the most effective with an average effective concentration of 53 \u03bcM against 12 different fungal species C8I6 combated fungal infections by disrupting both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial membranes impairing the proton motive force generating reactive oxygen species and triggering apoptosis in fungal cells Importantly C8I6 exhibited minimal hemolysis and cytotoxicity while effectively inhibiting fungal biofilm formation In vivo experiments further validated the safety and therapeutic potential of C8I6 in treating fungal skin infections These findings underscore the significance of

receptor agonists in schizophrenia a field of intense research since a seminal publication by Patel and colleagues 2007 We summarize evidence about selective potent and safe agents with quantifiable CNS penetration that can be used to test hypotheses of mGlu2 receptors involvement in neuropsychiatric diseases We summarize lessons learned from previous programs that should be considered to maximize the probability of success when targeting orthosteric and allosteric enhancement of mGlu2 receptor function in schizophrenia and beyond First we propose expanding our focus beyond presynaptic mGlu2 receptor stimulation in schizophrenia to novel hypotheses and that the choice of a therapeutic indication no longer be dictated by commercial opportunity but following science as a driver Second evidence on internal validity of preclinical studies supporting efficacy claims in the mGlu2 field is very limited This gap will need to be closed when reviewing the rationale to reinitiate efforts in this field Third the pomaglumetad program was halted due to insufficient clinical efficacy partly because of the inability to identify a treatment responder population In preclinical studies effects

metalion chelation properties Among them hydroxamic acidcontaining compounds 7r and 7f exhibited the best inhibitor activity against acetylcholinesterase AChE and butyrylcholinesterase BuChE respectively with the corresponding IC50 values of 041 and 106 \u03bcM which were superior to those of rivastigmine IC50  526 202 \u03bcM respectively Moreover compounds 7r and 7f presented excellent

MyDispense is one of the virtual simulations that has already been established as a suitable alternative for live experiential education in the pharmacy curriculum However there are no structured validated questionnaires available to assess the students perception while integrating MyDispense with pharmacy practice experiential education Therefore the present study aimed to validate a structured questionnaire and use the questionnaire to assess the student perception of various pharmacy practice experiential education METHODS Content and construct validity procedure was used to validate the questionnaire Two hundred students consented to participate in validating the questionnaire The validated questionnaire assessed the students perception of integrating MyDispense with Introductory Pharmacy Practice Experience 2 IPPE2 and Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experience APPE courses The questionnaire was structured with four domains which were exercise instructor technical and communication Each domain carried five items therefore the whole questionnaire had 20 items that succeeded in content validity In the survey 121 fourthyear and 117 fifthyear PharmD students volunteered to convey their perception of integrating MyDispense with IPPE 2 and APPE respectively The survey was conducted before and after the MyDispense exam in both the courses RESULTS The Cronbachs \u03b1 and McDonalds \u03c9 coefficients were  08 in all four domains indicating that the items related to the four domains have good internal consistency In Exploratory Factor Analysis EFA two items were found to crossload in the exercise domain and removed Therefore the EFA proposes 18 items for the confirmatory factor analysis CFA In CFA five fit indices were found to be satisfactory and this indicates construct was good enough to assess the student perception In IPPE 2 the pretest response the students had significantly higher satisfaction p  005 with all five items related to the technical domain In APPE the students had a significantly p  005 higher perception of all the items related to the exercise and technical domain in the pretest compared to the posttest Therefore the students pretest feedback allowed the instructor to identify and make the necessary corrections in the exercises to improve the quality exercises CONCLUSION This study provides a validated 18item questionnaire to assess the student perception of integrating MyDispense in experiential education The integration of MyDispense in experiential education needs to be done carefully by assessing

neurodegenerative diseases is associated with neuronal cell loss and cognitive dysfunction Monoacylglycerol lipase MAGL is involved in neuroinflammation in the brain via the degradation of endocannabinoid 2arachidonoylglycerol to arachidonic acid a precursor of some eicosanoids therefore MAGL inhibitors are expected to have antiinflammatory effects We recently developed a reversible selective central nervous system penetrant and orally available MAGL inhibitor compound 4f Compound 4f 1 mgkg robustly increased 2arachidonoylglycerol levels and decreased arachidonic acid levels in the mouse brain To examine whether compound 4f can suppress neuroinflammation and neuronal cell loss kainic acid KAinjected mice were used as a neuroinflammation model in this study Compound 4f 1 mgkg significantly decreased the cytokine and chemokine expression levels and suppressed neuronal cell loss in the hippocampi of mice Compound 4f also ameliorated cognitive impairment in KAinjected mice The cannabinoid receptor 1 antagonist AM251 and cannabinoid receptor 2 antagonist AM630 partly blocked the neuroprotective effects of compound 4f in the hippocampi of KAinjected mice Gene expression

thousand years and is considered the oldest infectious disease that still exists The Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacillus was spread worldwide due to human migrations and there is archaeological evidence of spinal tuberculosis cases in Egyptian and Andean mummies as well as texts that attributed the disease to social factors before suspecting its infectious nature Throughout its history humans have dealt with this pathology by developing unusual and ineffective therapies leading to a significant increase in the diseases mortality In the past century the first antibiotics were introduced bringing hope to eradicate this disease However evolutionary pressure has led to the emergence of multidrugresistant strains Today the development of computational techniques such as artificial intelligence has given us new hope for generating drugs and potential immunomodulatory therapies However it is essential to remember that those who do not know their history are doomed to repeat it In this review we summarize the history of tuberculosis analyzing theories of its possible origin its discovery the creation of the first empirical treatments vaccines the emergence of new antibiotics and how the mycobacterium quickly develops resistance Publisher La tuberculosis es una enfermedad ancestral que ha acompa\u00f1ado a la humanidad por los \u00faltimos tres mil a\u00f1os y

Intelligence Hefei Comprehensive National Science Center Hefei 230026 Anhui China Identifying drugtarget interactions DTIs is essential for drug discovery and development Existing deep learning approaches to DTI prediction often employ powerful feature encoders to represent drugs and targets holistically which usually cause significant redundancy and noise by neglecting the restricted binding regions Furthermore many previous DTI networks ignore or simplify the complex intermolecular interaction process involving diverse binding types which significantly limits both predictive ability and interpretability We propose ReduMixDTI an endtoend model that addresses feature redundancy and explicitly captures complex local interactions for DTI prediction In this study drug and target features are encoded by using graph neural networks and convolutional neural networks respectively These features are refined from channel and spatial perspectives to enhance the representations The proposed attention mechanism explicitly models pairwise interactions between drug and target substructures improving the models understanding of binding processes In extensive comparisons with seven stateoftheart methods ReduMixDTI demonstrates superior performance across three benchmark data sets and external test sets reflecting realworld scenarios Additionally we perform comprehensive ablation studies and visualize protein attention weights to enhance the interpretability The results confirm that ReduMixDTI serves as a robust and interpretable model for reducing feature redundancy contributing to advances in DTI prediction DOI 101021acsjcim4c01554 PMID 39570771", "1 Nucleic Acid Ther 2024 Nov 21 doi 101089nat20240069 Online ahead of print It is Time to

apparent by the accelerating pace of successful programs using duplex RNAs and antisense oligonucleotides to target mRNA Why has progress been slow A clear understanding of how miRNAs function in mammalian cells is obscured by the fact that miRNAs can exert their effects through multiple complex mechanisms This gap in our knowledge has complicated progress in drug discovery Better insights

University of South Carolina School of Medicine Columbia South Carolina United States Obesity increases the risk for developing several cancers including colorectal cancer CRC and is associated with liver perturbations which likely impacts treatment tolerance 5 fluorouracil 5FU remains a first line treatment for CRC but efficacy is hampered by interpatient variable responsiveness and off target toxicities The current study examined the impact of dietinduced obesity DIO on 5FU cytopenia and efficacy using two established CRC models MC38 C57BL6 and C26 CD2F1 DIO increased tumor size in both MC38 and C26 DIO reduced liver dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase dpyd expression the enzyme that catalyzes 5FUs catabolism to become inactive in MC38 mice but not C26 5FU remained efficacious against early MC38 and C26 tumor growth however 5FUinduced tumor and liver immune cell death was exacerbated following 3 cycles of 5FU with MC38 DIO caused dramatic changes to liver Kupffer Cells KC wherein there were increased prometastatic immunosuppressive KCs in Obese Control and MC38 5FU however depleted these KCs and increased inflammatory KCs in both Lean and Obese MC38 DIO yielded a milder obesity phenotype in CD2F1 mice and 5FUinduced cytopenia was not different between Lean and Obese DIO increased total liver KCs however C26 tumors increased liver KCs which were normalized with 5FU treatment irrespective of DIO While 5FU remained efficacious in both models of CRC and did not reduce survival multiple cycles of 5FU monotherapy increased liver and tumor immune cell death in DIO

environmental risk factors Given the polygenic aspect of ASD targeting several genesproteins responsible for pathogenesis at once might prove advantageous in its remediation Various phytochemicals have been proven to possess neuroprotective antiinflammatory and antioxidant properties by alleviating symptoms and targeting a complex network of genesproteins related to disease pathology However the effects of many of these phytochemicals on ASD are enigmatic and their molecular targets and molecular mechanisms are still elusive Here we provide a comprehensive comparative study on the therapeutic potential of 6 phytochemicals viz Cannabidiol Crocetin Epigallocatechin3gallate Fisetin Quercetin and Resveratrol based on their neuroprotective properties in managing ASD We aimed to identify and target a network of core proteins in the pathology of ASD via phytochemicals using network pharmacology molecular docking and simulation studies The methodology includes screening genesproteins implicated in ASD as targets of each phytochemical followed by network construction using ProteinProtein Interactions Gene Ontology and enrichment analysis The constructed network was further narrowed down to the hub genes in the network followed by their spatiotemporal analysis molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation 6 core genes were obtained for ASD 3 of which are directly involved in disease pathogenesis The study provides a set of novel genes that phytochemicals can target to ameliorate and regulate ASD pathogenesis Cannabidiol can inhibit ABCG2 MAOB and PDE4B Resveratrol can target ABCB1 and Quercetin can regulate AKR1C4 and XDH This study demonstrated the potential of phytochemicals to target and regulate ABCG2 ABCB1 AKR1C4 MAOB PDE4B and XDH which

Japan BACKGROUND Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic drug used for chemotherapyinduced nausea and vomiting It is particularly effective in preventing delayed nausea and vomiting induced by highly emetogenic chemotherapy HEC However it has side effects such as hyperglycemia and somnolence the efficacy and safety of adding olanzapine to triplet antiemetic therapy 5HT3 receptor antagonist NK1 receptor antagonist and dexamethasone must be verified METHODS We performed a systematic review and metaanalysis to compare the effectiveness of olanzapine combined with triplet antiemetic therapy and triplet antiemetic therapy in preventing nausea and vomiting for HEC We set five items hyperglycemia prevention of vomiting prevention of nausea adverse events and cost drug costs as outcomes and conducted a systematic review RESULTS Five randomized controlled trials was extracted and they showed that the addition of olanzapine was effective in control of nausea and vomiting especially in the delayed phase Complete response of acute and delayed phase were significantly higher in the olanzapine group Risk difference was  014 95 CI  026  003 p  002 and  014 95 CI  019 009 p  000001 respectively Additionally we evaluated hyperglycemia and somnolence which are typical side effects of olanzapine However the incidence of grade  2 was low in both events and there was no significant difference between olanzapine and control groups CONCLUSIONS Adding olanzapine to triplet antiemetic therapy is useful in preventing nausea and vomiting induced by HEC and there would be minimal adverse effects from the combination use  2024 The Authors under exclusive licence to Japan Society of Clinical Oncology DOI 101007s10147024026634 PMID 39570460 Conflict of interest statement

2020000292hmceducn Type 2 diabetes mellitus T2DM is a metabolic disorder that is characterized by insulin resistance and hyperglycemia It is also known to be a risk factor for Alzheimers disease AD Insulin plays a crucial role in regulating the bodys metabolism and is responsible for activating the Phosphoinotide3Kinase PI3KProtein Kinase B Akt signaling pathway This pathway is activated when insulin binds to the insulin receptor on nerve cells and it helps regulate the metabolism of glucose and lipids Dysfunction in the insulin signaling pathway can lead to a decrease in brain insulin levels and insulin sensitivity thereby inducing disruptions in insulin signal transduction and leading to disorders in brain energy metabolism Moreover these dysfunctions also contribute to the accumulation of \u03b2amyloid A\u03b2 deposition and the hyperphosphorylation of Tau protein both of which are characteristic features of AD Therefore this article focuses on insulin resistance to reveal the complex mechanism between brain insulin resistance and AD occurrence in T2DM On this basis this article further summarizes the biological effects and mechanisms of antidiabetic drugs on the two diseases aiming to provide new ideas for the discovery of drugs for the treatment of T2DM combined with AD  2024 The Authors under exclusive licence to Springer ScienceBusiness Media LLC part of

view of the significance of both \u03b2lactam antibiotics and the production of one or more \u03b2lactamases as the major resistance mechanism especially in Gramnegative bacteria we implemented an original approach to selectively deliver antibacterial zidovudine AZT exploiting the \u03b2lactamasemediated hydrolysis of a \u03b2lactamconjugate prodrug The synthesis of the targeted pronucleosides was performed in 57 steps and based on an original Pdcatalyzed crosscoupling reaction Enzymatic and microbiological evaluations were performed to evaluate the synthesized pronucleosides yielding new insights into molecular recognition of \u03b2lactamase enzymes This approach would potentially allow a targeted and selective eradication of antibioticresistant \u03b2lactamaseproducing opportunistic pathogens as the inactive prodrug is unable to harm the commensal microbial flora DOI 101039d4ob01396d PMID 39569564", "1 Drug Dev Res 2024 Dec858e70022 doi 101002ddr70022 Design Synthesis and

cell growth However traditional methodologies for studying lactylation have predominantly relied on peptide enrichment from wholecell lysates which tend to favor the detection of highabundance peptides thus limiting the identification of lowabundance lactylated peptides To address this limitation here we employed subcellular fractionation to separate proteins and map lactylated peptides from each isolated subcellular fraction using a model cell line In brief we identified 1217 lysine lactylation Kla sites on 553 proteins across four subcellular fractions Subsequent pathway enrichment analysis revealed that Kla proteins participate in distinct pathways depending on the subcellular contexts In addition this subcellular fractionation method enabled the discovery of 36 previously unreported Kla proteins and 223 novel Kla sites many of which are present in low abundance Notably several proteins contain multiple newly identified Kla sites exemplified by the transcriptional regulator ATRX Furthermore our results indicate the possibility of PTM crosstalk between Kla and other PTMs such as ubiquitination and sumoylation In conclusion subcellular fractionation facilitates the identification of Kla proteins that have been previously uncovered and could be overlooked by affinity enrichment of wholecell lysates DOI 101021jasms4c00366 PMID 39569522", "1 iScience 2024 Oct

treatment of cancers with mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 that are deficient in homologous recombination The identification of modulators of PARP1 activity is critical to understand and overcome resistance to PARPis We integrated data from three omicsscale screens to discover new regulators of PARP1 activity We identified SART1 and show that its silencing leads to an increase in polyADP ribosylation and chromatinbound PARP1 SART1 is recruited to chromatin following DNA damage and limits PARP1 chromatin retention and activity The SART1 Nterminus is sufficient to regulate the accumulation of PAR chains and PARP1 on chromatin an activity dependent on the RGGRG box Silencing of SART1 leads to an increased sensitivity of cells to DNA damage induced by IR irrespective of BRCA1

exhibiting a trans amide in the macrocyclic backbone However for the fluorinated macrocycle the major trans amide conformation is in equilibrium with a cis amide minor conformation seen by 1H NMR in a 4  1 ratio of transcis The conformational fits for the minor fluorinated isomer demonstrate the out of plane preference of the difluoroalkoxy system encouraging the amide within the macrocycle backbone to adopt a cis conformation The fluorinated macrocycle was less metabolically stable compared to the nonfluorinated postulated to be a result of the interconversion of trans amide to the cis

induced pluripotent stem cells hiPSCs derived from reprogrammed adult somatic cells hold significant promise for disease modelling personalized medicine drug discovery and regenerative therapies Public awareness and understanding of hiPSCs are crucial for advancing research in this field However limited data exists on the general populations knowledge and attitudes toward their use METHODS This study aimed to assess the awareness and perceptions of hiPSCs among Italian adults through a webbased survey conducted via the EUSurvey platform using a snowball sampling approach The survey included demographic information and mandatory questions on knowledge awareness and concerns regarding hiPSC technology with responses collected on a 3point scale Statistical analysis was performed using chisquared tests with significance set at p  005 RESULTS Out of 1874 respondents the majority were aged 1835 years 405 female 634 and universityeducated 672 Among those familiar with hiPSCs 541 n  1201 953 expressed willingness to donate blood samples for hiPSC generation to treat individuals with incurable diseases Concerns about current research and therapeutic applications were low less than 20 but nearly half of the respondents were hesitant or opposed to the use of hiPSCs in animal experiments and their commercialization by pharmaceutical companies Increased skepticism was observed in older less educated religious individuals and those who were not blood donors Overall the Italian public shows strong support for hiPSCbased therapies though reservations exist around specific ethical and economic issues DISCUSSION These findings underscore the importance of addressing public concerns through targeted educational campaigns not only in Italy but globally to foster a more informed and supportive environment for advancing stem cell research and its clinical applications worldwide Similar studies have been conducted in Japan the United States and Sweden but there remains a need for all countries to engage with their citizens to better understand how stem cell research is perceived locally Such engagement is crucial for guiding international strategies in personalized

their molecular targets is a fundamental aspect of drug discovery and repurposing Drugtarget interactions are important for elucidating mechanisms of action and optimizing drug efficacy and safety profiles Several computational methods have been developed to systematically predict drugtarget interactions However computational and experimental validation of the drugtarget predictions greatly vary across the studies AREAS COVERED Through a PubMed query a corpus comprising 3286 articles on drugtarget interaction prediction published within the past decade was covered Natural language processing was used for automated abstract classification to study the evolution of computational methods validation strategies and performance assessment metrics in the 3286 articles Additionally a manual analysis of 259 studies that performed experimental validation of computational predictions revealed prevalent experimental protocols EXPERT OPINION Starting from 2014 there has been a noticeable increase in articles focusing on drugtarget interaction prediction Docking and regression stands out as the most commonly used techniques among computational methods and crossvalidation is frequently employed as the computational validation strategy Testing the predictions using multiple orthogonal validation strategies is recommended and should be reported for the specific target prediction applications Experimental validation remains relatively rare and should be performed more routinely to evaluate biological relevance of predictions DOI 1010801746044120242430955 PMID

compounds for further drug discovery however numerous unrelated chemical constituents in crude extracts may obscure the effective ingredients in LCMS analysis OBJECTIVE The aim of this study is to construct a biolayer interferometry BLIbased system for recognizing active ingredients that inhibit the main protease Mpro of SARSCoV2 and to identify the active chemical components binding to Mpro from herbal medicines METHODOLOGY We developed a novel FRET fluorogenic probe by linking the amino acid sequences of the fluorescent proteins Lssmorange and mKate2 LsmK The interaction between traditional Chinese medicine and Mpro was analyzed using BLI Ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole timeofflight mass spectrometry UPLCQTOFMS was employed to analyze the composition of herbal medicines RESULTS Fluorescence detection and spectroscopy confirmed the successful construction of an Mpro inhibitor screening system Lanqin Oral Liquid LQL and Gardeniae fructus exhibited strong inhibitory effects on Mpro Ten compounds were identified from G fructus extracts among them deacetyl asperulosidic acid methyl ester DAAME and Gardoside were found to strongly bind to Mpro with dissociation constants KD of 341 \u03bcM and 801 nM respectively The halfmaximal inhibitory concentrations IC50 of DAAME and Gardoside for Mpro were 2746 and 137 \u03bcM respectively CONCLUSION This study established a functional Mpro inhibitor screening system Among the 10 components identified from G fructus that bind to Mpro DAAME and Gardoside displayed strong binding and

Minatoku Tokyo Japan 7Center for Infectious Disease Education and Research Osaka University Suita Osaka Japan BACKGROUND Inhibition of sperm maturation in the epididymis is a promising posttesticular strategy for shortacting male contraceptives It has been shown that ROS1 a receptor tyrosine kinase expressed in the epididymis is essential for epididymal differentiation sperm maturation and male fertility in mice However it is unknown if inhibition of ROS1 suppresses male fertility reversibly OBJECTIVES Our study aimed to investigate the effects of ROS1 inhibitor administration in male mice on sperm function and fertility MATERIALS AND METHODS We used lorlatinib an anticancer drug that inhibits ROS1 We treated 10weekold sexually mature male mice with lorlatinib for 3 weeks and performed fertility tests histological staining in vitro fertilization sperm motility analyses and immunoblot analyses We also performed the same analyses 3 weeks after discontinuing the lorlatinib treatment RESULTS Inhibition of ROS1 for 3 weeks suppressed male fertility Lorlatinibtreated mice showed no overt abnormalities in testicular sections but epithelium maintenance of the epididymal initial segment was impaired Accordingly the levels of OVCH2 RNASE10 and ADAM28 which are expressed in the epididymis decreased Spermatozoa from the lorlatinibtreated mice lost their ability to bind to the zona pellucida and ADAM3 processing was abnormal Sperm motility was also impaired in the lorlatinibtreated mice These impairments were recovered 3 weeks after discontinuing the drug treatment DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION Inhibition of ROS1 with lorlatinib suppressed sperm maturation and male fertility reversibly Future exploration of molecules that specifically target ROS1 and the ROS1 pathway in the epididymis may lead to the development of safe and reversible male contraceptives  2024 The Authors Andrology published by John Wiley  Sons Ltd on behalf of American Society of

cell membranes and deliver molecules into cells Several models have been developed for their discovery yet these models often face challenges in accurately predicting membrane penetration due to the complex nature of peptidecell interactions Hence there is a need for innovative approaches that can enhance predictive performance EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH In this study we present the application GraphCPP a novel graph neural network GNN for the prediction of membrane penetration capability of peptides KEY RESULTS A new comprehensive datasetdubbed CPP1708was constructed resulting in the largest reliable database of CPPs to date Comparative analyses with previous methods such as MLCPP2 C2Pred CellPPD and CellPPDMod demonstrated the superior predictive performance of our model Upon testing against other published methods GraphCPP performs exceptionally achieving 05787 Matthews correlation coefficient and 08459 area under the curve AUC values on one dataset This means a 928 and 233 improvement in Matthews correlation coefficient and AUC measures respectively compared with the next best model The capability of the model to effectively learn peptide representations was demonstrated through tdistributed stochastic neighbour embedding plots Additionally the uncertainty analysis revealed that GraphCPP maintains high confidence in predictions for peptides shorter than 40 amino acids The source code is available at httpsgithubcomattilaimre99GraphCPP CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS These findings indicate the potential of GNNbased models to improve CPP penetration

related proteins such as tau \u03b2amyloid APP and \u03b1synuclein is an important focus in the research of neurodegenerative proteinopathy By analyzing the serum RNA extracted from wildtype and Alzheimers disease AD transgenic mice at different ages 4 8 and 12 months this study revealed a new protective role of FBXL16 in AD primarily through facilitating the degradation of diseaserelated proteins via the ubiquitin proteasome system METHODS Proteomic analysis were conducted using protein lysates from HEK293 cells overexpressing FBXL16 to identify potential interacting proteins that interact with FBXL16 Subsequent experiments demonstrated that FBXL16 promotes the proteasomal degradation of the APP protein as evidenced by coimmunoprecipitation with MG132 and cycloheximide CHX immunohistochemistry IHC and immunocytochemistry ICC Memory and cognitive improvements were observed in 3Tg AD mice through the use of a lentivirusmediated approach to generate a brainspecific AD mouse model overexpressing FBXL16 via stereotaxic injection Furthermore a brainspecific conditional knockout cko FBXL16 mouse model was generated and employed to further confirm the functional role of FBXL 16 in AD via various behavioral tests including Morris water maze and Ymaze RESULTS The level of FBXL16 in the brains of transgenic APPPSEN mice with AD decreased with age Accelerated degradation of APP was observed when FBXL16 was overexpressed in the hippocampi of these AD mice via a lentivirus This process led to notable improvements in cognitive impairments and reductions in neuroinflammation Further studies using proteomics and bioinformatics techniques identified transcription factors and binding proteins associated with FBXL16 providing deeper insights into the potential role of FBXL16 in the regulation of AD Finally the in vivo effects of FBXL16 deficiency were further substantiated in cko mice which overexpress A\u03b2 but specifically lack FBXL16 in the brain region CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest that FBXL16 could be a new regulator of AD These findings provide a foundation for further research into drug development and potential therapeutic strategies to combat other related neurodegenerative proteinopathies  2024 The Authors DOI 101186s4036402400691w PMCID PMC11580471 PMID 39568047 Conflict of interest statement Declarations Ethics

applications in ovarian protection although the exact mechanism is unknown The present study preliminarily investigated the pharmacological mechanism of IAA in alleviating diminished ovarian reserve DOR by network pharmacology and molecular docking METHODS Relevant target proteins of IAA were searched in SwissTargetPrediction PharmMapper TargetNet BATMANTCM and SuperPred databases The potential targets of DOR were obtained from GeneCards DisGenet OMIM and Drugbank databases Both common targets were then imported into the String website to construct a PPI network and these targets were analyzed for GO and KEGG enrichment Finally we utilized molecular docking to validate the possible binding conformations between IAA and the candidate targets We used in vitro experiments to preliminarily investigate the effects of IAA on DOR RESULTS We obtained 88 potential targets for IAA and DOR interaction We received 16 pivotal targets by constructed protein interaction screening KEGG enrichment analysis mainly included the AGERAGE signaling pathway IL17 signaling pathway Chemical carcinogenesisreactive oxygen species in diabetic complications etc GO functional analysis showed that IAA treatment of DOR may involve biological processes such as response to external stimuli hypoxia gene expression and regulation of enzyme activity Molecular docking and in vitro experiments further revealed the potential effects of IAA on MMP2 TNF\u03b1 AKT1 HSP90AA1 and NF\u03ba B CONCLUSION We preliminarily revealed the potential protective effects of IAA against DOR through multiple targets and pathways which provides a new research strategy for the molecular mechanism of IAA to alleviate DOR in the future However further studies need to demonstrate whether IAA can be used as a compound to prevent and treat DOR  2024 The Authors DOI 101186s41065024003486 PMCID PMC11580193 PMID 39568012 Indexed for MEDLINE Conflict of interest statement Declarations Ethics approval and

the treatment of gout familial Mediterranean fever and pericarditis but its narrow therapeutic window presents a significant risk of severe toxicity Despite its clinical relevance the molecular mechanisms underlying colchicines pharmacological effects and associated toxicity and explored potential therapeutic interventions to mitigate its adverse effects We showed the colchicines impact on cellular morphology in human umbilical vein endothelial cells HUVEC and HeLa cells including cell rounding and detachment following 24 h of exposure that revealed pronounced cytotoxic effects We then established a largescale screening model to identify small molecules capable of reversing colchicineinduced cellular toxicity and identified MLN4924 an inhibitor of the CullinRING E3 ligase CRL system as a promising candidate for mitigating colchicineinduced cellular injury Through a comprehensive multiomics approach including transcriptomics proteomics phosphoproteomics and ubiquitinomics we systematically characterized the molecular perturbations caused by colchicine and delineated the protective mechanisms of MLN4924 We found that MLN4924 exerted its protective effects by modulating critical cellular pathways specifically preventing the dysregulation of cell cycle progression mitotic disruption and microtubule destabilization triggered by colchicine Furthermore proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses revealed significant alterations in kinase signaling networks with combined inhibition of CDK1 and PAK1 emerging as an effective strategy to counteract colchicineinduced cellular dysfunction These results not only provide a detailed molecular characterization of colchicine toxicity but also identify key therapeutic targets laying the groundwork for the development of

and functional food Extractions from G globosa have been reported to exert hepatoprotective effects We further hypothesized that the polysaccharide components as a bioactive ingredient might have antifatty and hepatitis function Here a novel homogeneous arabinoglucan GGL005S1 Mw  839 kDa from this flower was characterized by monosaccharide composition analysis methylation analysis and NMR Structural analysis showed that the backbone of GGL005S1 consists of 4\u03b1Glcp1 and 46\u03b1Glcp1 residues and the branched chain linked to the main chain via C6 of 46\u03b1Glcp1 in the form \u03b1Araf14\u03b1Glcp1b b  2 In vitro experiments demonstrated that GGL005S1 could inhibit lipid deposition and ROS overload in free fatty acidinduced hepatocytes meanwhile in vivo tests showed that GGL005S1 effectively protected against liver injury steatohepatitis and fibrosis in a CDAHFDfed MASH model Mechanism study further uncovered that GGL005S1 augmented the expression and antioxidant ability of thioredoxin protein that ameliorated oxidative stress promoted fatty acid \u03b2oxidation and mitophagy up to reducing lipotoxicity and alleviating inflammation via inhibiting NLRP3

cancer care It is now feasible for patients to complete PROMs electronically ePROMs providing information about their current levels of symptoms side effects of treatment and other concerns PROM scores can be tracked over time allowing more timely identification of problems and more appropriate intervention Studies have reported clear benefits in patientclinician communication when PROMs are used and trials in the USA and France found patients randomised to complete regular ePROMs reported better healthrelated quality of life had fewer unplanned hospital visits and importantly significantly better survival than those randomised to usual care However information about the effects on health outcomes and particularly the costeffectiveness of incorporating this information into practice is limited METHODS AND ANALYSIS PROMISE Patient Reported Outcome Measures in cancer care a hybrid effectivenessImplementation trial to optimise Symptom control and health service Experience

threat to global health The rapid emergence of resistance contrasts with the slow pace of antimicrobial development emphasizing the urgent need for innovative drug discovery approaches This study addresses a critical bottleneck in early drug development by introducing integral solventinduced protein precipitation iSPP to rapidly assess the targetengagement of lead compounds in extracts of pathogenic microorganisms under closetophysiological conditions iSPP measures the change in protein stability against solventinduced precipitation in the presence of ligands The iSPP method for bacteria builds upon established SPP procedures and features optimized denaturation gradients and minimized sample input amounts The effectiveness of the iSPP workflow was initially demonstrated through a multidrug targetengagement study Using quantitative mass spectrometry LCMSMS we successfully identified known drug targets of seven different antibiotics in cell extracts of four AMRrelated pathogens the three Gramnegative bacteria Escherichia coli Klebsiella pneumoniae Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the Grampositive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus The iSPP method was ultimately applied to demonstrate targetengagement of compounds derived from targetbased drug discovery We employed five small molecules targeting three enzymes in the 2Cmethylderythritol 4phosphate MEP pathwaya promising focus for antiinfective drug development The study showcases iSPP adaptability and efficiency in identifying antiinfective drug targets advancing earlystage drug discovery against AMR DOI

Oral delivery of peptides requires formulations with high concentrations of permeation enhancer PE to promote absorption and often necessitates fasting time between dosing and food ingestion Improved formulations promoting a more rapid absorption would increase convenience of use but requires a faster onset of action We have developed a salcaprozatebased ionic liquid IL formulation namely choline salcaprozate CHONAC for oral delivery of a glucagonlike peptide1 GLP1 analogue via gastric absorption In vitro studies confirmed the higher amount of PE accommodated in the same volume of dosage form as well as faster release of the active pharmaceutical ingredient API and PE compared to the tablet reference Storage stability of the CHONAC formulation was demonstrated for up to 3 weeks at 4 C The peptide absorption efficacy of the IL formulation was first evaluated in vivo in rats and anesthetized dogs showing a faster absorption compared to the reference formulations In awake dogs while the CHONAC formulation still enabled earlier API absorption its overall exposure was inferior to the tablet reference This was attributed mostly to the gastric physiology causing formulation dilution in the presence of additional fluid as well as fast transit of liquids into the duodenum where peptides liable to proteolytic degradation such as the one used in this study showed a negligible absorption potentially also due to a lower permeationenhancing capability of CHONAC in the duodenal region Exploring these issues an in vivo study in anesthetized dogs involving repeated dosing of a liquid salcaprozatebased formulation in the stomach revealed the potential to sustain peptide absorption throughout the dosing period with a constant absorption rate In conclusion combining the advantages of high PE amounts and fast onset of action provided by the IL formulation and ensuring a prolonged interaction of peptide and PE at a relevant concentration with the stomach epithelium are necessary to enhance oral peptide bioavailability via gastric delivery Copyright  2024 The Authors Published by Elsevier BV All rights reserved DOI 101016jjconrel202411036 PMID 39566853", "1 Int J Biol Macromol

traditional experimental methods are highly accurate for identifying Kla sites they are both timeconsuming and laborintensive Recent machine learning advances have enabled computational models for Kla site prediction In this study we propose a novel framework that integrates sequence embedding with sequence descriptors to enhance the representation of protein sequence features Our framework employs a BiGRUTransformer architecture to capture both local and global dependencies within the sequence while incorporating six sequence descriptors to extract biochemical properties and evolutionary patterns Additionally we apply a crossattention fusion mechanism to combine sequence embeddings with descriptorbased features enabling the model to capture complex interactions between different feature representations Our model demonstrated excellent performance in predicting Kla sites achieving an accuracy of 0998 on the training set and 0969 on the independent set Additionally through attention analysis and motif discovery our model provided valuable insights into key sequence patterns and regions that are crucial for Kla modification This work not only deepens the understanding of

July 3rd to 7th 2023 from 8 speakers in the field of resolution of inflammation resolution pharmacology and resolution biology It is now accepted that the acute inflammatory response is protective to defend the host against infection or tissue injury Acute inflammation is selflimited and programmed to be limited in space and time this is achieved through endogenous resolution processes that ensure return to homeostasis Resolution is brought about by agonist mediators that include specialized proresolving lipid mediators SPMs and proresolving proteins and peptides such as annexin A1 and angiotensin17 all acting to initiate antiinflammatory and proresolving processes If the inflammatory reaction remains unchecked through dysfunctional resolution mechanism it can become chronic and contribute to a plethora of human diseases including respiratory cardiovascular metabolic allergic diseases and arthritis Herein we discuss how nonresolving inflammation plays a role in the pathogenesis of these diseases In addition to SPMs we highlight the discovery biosynthesis biofunctions and latest research updates on innovative therapeutics including annexinA1 peptidemimetic RTP026

from the impaired action of insulin production of insulin or both of these simultaneously Consequently it causes problems or failure of different body organs such as kidneys heart eyes nerve system Since this disease cannot be completely cured until now we aimed to design series of enzymes inhibitors and tested them for DM treatment In this series benzimidazolebased thiazolidinone bearing chalcone derivatives completed in a four step reaction and their structures were confirmed through various spectroscopic techniques A significant efficacy on antidiabetic enzymes was observed with IC50 values ranging from 2505  004 to 5608  007 \u03bcM for \u03b1amylase and 2207  002 to 5306  007 \u03bcM for \u03b1glucosidase The obtained results were compared to those of the standard glimepiride drug IC50  1805  007 \u00b5M for \u03b1amylase and IC50  1502  0 03 \u00b5M for \u03b1glucosidase The synthesized compounds showed promising antidiabetic potency Moreover a molecular docking study was conducted on the most active analogs of the compounds to better understand their interactions with the active sites of the targeted enzymes  2024 Walter de Gruyter GmbH BerlinBoston

for drug discovery with methods for generating conformers often based on molecular metadynamics or sophisticated sampling techniques These methods are constrained by the underlying force computation regarding runtime and energy ranking accuracy limiting their effectiveness for largescale screening applications To address these ranking limitations we introduce ConfRank a machine learningbased approach that enhances conformer ranking using pairwise training We demonstrate its performance using GFNFFgenerated conformer ensembles leveraging the DimeNet architecture trained on pairs of 159 760 uncharged organic compounds from the GEOM data set with r2SCAN3c reference level Instead of predicting only on single molecules this approach captures relative energy differences between conformers leading to a significant improvement of the overall conformational ranking outperforming GFNFF and GFN2xTB Thereby the pairwise RMSD of the relative energy difference of two conformers can be reduced from 565 to 071 kcal mol1 on the test data set allowing to correctly identify up to 81 of all lowest lying conformers correctly GFNFF 10 GFN2xTB 47 The ConfRank approach is costeffective allowing for scalable deployment on both CPU and GPU achieving runtime accelerations by up to 2 orders of magnitude compared to GFN2xTB Outofsample investigations on CRESTgenerated conformer ensembles from the QM9 data set and conformers taken from an extended GMTKN55 data set show promising results for the robustness of this approach Thereby ranking correlation coefficient such as Spearman can be improved to 090 GFNFF 039 GFN2xTB 084 reducing the probability of an incorrect sign flip in pairwise energy comparison from 32 to 7 On the extended GMTKN55 subsets the pairwise MAD RMSD could be reduced on almost all subsets by up to 62 58 with an average improvement of 30 29 Moreover an exemplary case study on vancomycin shows similar performance indicating applicability to larger biomolecular structures Furthermore we motivate the usage of the pairwise training approach from a theoretical perspective highlighting that while pairwise training can lead to a decline in single sample prediction of absolute energies for ML models it significantly enhances conformer ranking performance The data and models used in this study are available at httpsgithubcomgrimmelabconfrank DOI 101021acsjcim4c01524

suffers from nerve degeneration or peripheral nerve damage Despite this there are major gaps in the knowledge of human PNS development and degeneration therefore there are no available treatments Familial dysautonomia FD is a devastating disorder caused by a homozygous point mutation in the gene ELP1 FD specifically affects the development and causes degeneration of the PNS We previously used patientderived induced pluripotent stem cells iPSCs to show that peripheral sensory neurons SNs recapitulate the developmental and neurodegenerative defects observed in FD Here we conducted a chemical screen to identify compounds that rescue the SN differentiation inefficiency in FD We identified that genipin restores neural crest and SN development in patientderived iPSCs and in two mouse models of FD Additionally genipin prevented FD degeneration in SNs derived from patients with FD suggesting that it could be used to ameliorate neurodegeneration Moreover genipin crosslinked the extracellular matrix ECM increased the stiffness of the ECM reorganized the actin cytoskeleton and promoted transcription of yesassociated proteindependent genes Last genipin enhanced axon regeneration in healthy sensory and sympathetic neurons part of the PNS and in prefrontal cortical neurons part of the central nervous system in in vitro axotomy models Our results suggest that genipin has the potential to treat FDrelated neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative phenotypes and to enhance neuronal regeneration of healthy neurons after injury Moreover this suggests that the ECM can be targeted to treat FD DOI 101126scitranslmedadq2418 PMID 39565876 Indexed for MEDLINE", "1 Sci Adv 2024 Nov 221047eadr5807 doi 101126sciadvadr5807 Epub 2024 Nov 20 Structure of the human

causative agent of nontyphoidal salmonellosis NTS is one of several serovars that causes invasive NTS disease iNTS in humans S Panama is an understudied pathogen with its pathobiology poorly understood It is a predominant iNTS serovar in Australia a highincome country with high rates of salmonellosis where S Panama has been documented to have a high odds ratio 1391526 for causing iNTS This study investigates the genomic epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance profiles of all S Panama isolates recovered in Victoria Australia between 2000 and 2021 We examined the infection dynamics of S Panama in seven isolates representing the genetic diversity of the study population Two sublineages encompassed within a previously described Asian lineage were identified Multidrug resistance resistance to 3 drug classes was detected in 46 517 Australian isolates The plasmidmediated colistin resistance gene mcr11 was detected in one Australian S Panama isolate carried by an IncI plasmid previously reported in Salmonella and Escherichia coli isolates collected from poultry in SouthEast Asia Examination of the intracellular replication dynamics of S Panama isolates demonstrated diverse phenotypes In THP1 derived macrophages despite low host cell uptake S Panama showed higher replication rates over time compared to S enterica serovar Typhimurium However a causative genotype could not be identified to explain this observed phenotype This study provides insights into the S Panama isolates circulating in Australia over twodecades finding that 78 were linked to international travel suggesting importation in Australia It shows MDR was common in this iNTS serovar and colistin resistance reported for the first time It provides the first data on the hostpathogen interactions of S

available building blocks for chemical synthesis yet their direct homologation is unknown This valuable transformation currently necessitates implementation of multistep processes that require the use of carboxylic acid derivatives rather than the native substrates and commonly involves highly reactive and toxic reagents Herein we report the first onestep homologation directly from native carboxylic acids using a novel benchstable 1phosphorylvinyl sulfonate reagent under mild conditions This strategy was applied to a wide range of aliphatic carboxylic acid building blocks and biologically relevant complex molecules to access an array of ester amide and carboxylic acid homologues in a single step The 1phosphorylvinyl sulfonate reagent participates in complementary homologation protocols featuring either radicalchain transfer or organic photoredox catalysis and introduces a new synthon the distonic acylium radical for molecular diversification We anticipate this

glycosyltransferase EXT1 and EXT2 genes are linked to HME pathogenesis with EXT1 mutation being the most frequent The aim of this study was to generate a mice model with Ext1 gene editing to simulate human EXT1 mutation and investigate the genetic pathogenicity of Ext1 through phenotypic analyses We designed a pair of dual sgRNAs targeting exon 1 of the mice Ext1 gene for precise deletion of a 46 bp DNA fragment resulting in frameshift mutation of the Ext1 gene The designed dual sgRNAs and Cas9 proteins were injected into mice zygotes cytoplasm A total of 14 mice were obtained via embryo transfer among which two genotypic chimera mice had a deletion of the 46 bp DNA fragment in exon 1 of the Ext1 gene By hybridization and breeding we successfully generated heterozygous mice with edited Ext1 gene Ext Offtarget effect analysis did not reveal offtarget mutations in Ext mice caused by the two sgRNAs used Compared to wildtype mice Ext mice exhibited lower body weights Xray imaging showed hyperplastic bone near caudal vertebrae only in male Ext mice with computed tomography values approximately at 200 HU for hyperplastic bone between ribs and spine regions Furthermore immunohistochemical analysis revealed fewer articular chondrocytes expressing EXT1 in edited mice compared to wildtype ones Pathological section analysis demonstrated no structural or morphological abnormalities in heart liver lung or kidney tissues from Ext mice In conclusion we successfully generated an accurate DNA deletion model for studying Ext1 using dual sgRNAsCas9 systems In conclusion we successfully generated precise DNA deletions in the Ext1 mice model using the dual sgRNAsCas9 system In conclusion we observed significant phenotypic changes in Ext mice particularly bone hyperplasia in male individuals however no exostosis was detected in the geneedited mice The introduction of a frameshift mutation into the Ext1 gene through CRISPRCas9 technology resulted in novel

is a strong barrier to drugs nutrients and other essential deliverables This layer also houses a large consortium of microbes which thrive in tandem with human tissue providing several health benefits Moreover the complex interplay of the microbiome with the barrier tissue is poorly understood Therefore replicating these barrier tissues on microdevices to generate physiological and

possible to solve the structures of numerous Family A and Family B G proteincoupled receptors GPCRs in complex with G proteins and arrestins as well as several Family C GPCRs Determination of these structures has been facilitated by the presence of large extramembrane components such as G protein arrestin or Venus flytrap domains in these complexes that aid in particle alignment during the processing of the cryoEM data In contrast determination of the inactive state structure of Family A GPCRs is more challenging due to the relatively small size of the seven transmembrane domain 7TM and to the surrounding detergent micelle that in the absence of other features make particle alignment impossible Here we describe an alternative protein engineering strategy where the heterodimeric protein calcineurin is fused to a GPCR by three points of attachment the cytoplasmic ends of TM5 TM6 and TM7 This threepoint attachment provides a more rigid link with the GPCR transmembrane domain that facilitates particle alignment during data processing allowing us to determine the structures of the \u03b22 adrenergic receptor \u03b22AR in the apo antagonistbound and agonistbound states We expect that this fusion strategy may have broad application in cryoEM structural determination of other Family A GPCRs DOI 101073pnas2414544121 PMID 39565314 Indexed for MEDLINE Conflict of interest

pharmacotherapies METHODS Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography detected nine phytocompounds in AG and seven in JG Seven fatty acids were additionally identified in JG by Gas ChromatographyMass Spectrometry analysis The invivo efficacy of the coadministration of AG which was administered orally at the doses of 20 60 and 200 mgkgday and JG which was topically applied 100 mganimalday was evaluated in Wistar rats by inducing hemorrhoids development with the application of croton oil preparation COP in the rectoanal area Prednisolone was employed as the standard drug and was administered orally at the dose of 1 mgkgday RESULTS AG and JG were able to attenuate the croton oilinduced macro and microscopic anomalies Gross pathological observation demonstrated remarkable decrease in croton oilinduced swelling hemorrhage and formation of pseudomembrane with the escalating doses of AG Microscopic observation revealed alleviation in the histopathological lesions necrosis inflammation hemorrhagecongestion degeneration and dilatation of blood vessels AG and JG additionally reduced COPinduced in the serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines CONCLUSION This study convincingly demonstrates that coadministration of AG and JG is a potential therapy against hemorrhoids warranting further investigations DOI 1010800363904520242432595 PMID 39565131", "1 Antimicrob

Imipenem IPM and cefoxitin FOX are injectable \u03b2lactams recommended during the intensive treatment phase of pulmonary infections caused by Mycobacterium abscessus Mab However their potency against Mab is manyfold lower than against Grampositive and Gramnegative pathogens for which they were optimized putting into question their clinical utility Here we show that adding the recently approved durlobactamsulbactam DURSUL pair to either IPM or FOX achieves growth inhibition bactericidal and cytolytic activity at concentrations that are within those achieved in patients and below the clinical breakpoints established for each agent Synergies between DURSUL and IPM or FOX were confirmed across a large panel of clinical isolates Through in vitro resistant mutant selection we also show that adding DURSUL abrogates acquired resistance to IPM and FOX Since the use of \u03b2lactam injectables is firmly grounded in clinical practice during the intensive treatment phase of Mab pulmonary disease their potentiation by FDAapproved DURSUL to bring minimum inhibitory concentration distributions within achievable concentration ranges could offer significant shortterm benefits to patients

selective sphingosine 1phosphate S1P145 receptor modulator for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis and in development for the treatment of immunemediated inflammatory diseases Interaction between S1P and its five receptor subtypes S1P1S1P5 plays a role in several physiologic systems including the cardiovascular and immune systems Since differences in S1PR binding and downstream intracellular signaling could contribute to distinct profiles of drug efficacy and safety we directly compared the S1P15 selectivity profile of etrasimod to three marketed S1PR modulators fingolimod ozanimod and siponimod Using both heterologous expression systems and human umbilical vein endothelial cells that spontaneously express S1P1 we profiled key S1P1 downstream signaling pathways and found that etrasimod had similar potency to the other tested S1PR modulators in promoting \u03b2arrestin recruitment and S1P1 internalization However etrasimod was notably less potent than other S1PR modulators in assays measuring S1P1mediated G protein activation GTP\u03b3S binding and cAMP inhibition Relatively lower potency of etrasimod in inducing G protein signaling corresponded to significantly diminished activation of human cardiac G proteincoupled inwardly rectifying potassium channels when compared to ozanimod Together with pharmacokinetic properties this

species thanatin acts both by forming transmembranal pores and inhibiting outer membrane biogenesis by binding to LptA and blocking lipopolysaccharide LPS transport Inspired by previous modifications of thanatin an analogue was prepared which demonstrated potent but selective activity towards E coli Furthermore this compound was shown to act in synergy with the highly potent FDAapproved lipopeptide antibiotic polymyxin B which engages LPS at the cytoplasmic membrane Four analogues of thanatin in which the disulfide was substituted for vinyl sulfide bridge mimetics were prepared all of which retained similar secondary structures Two of these retained substantial potency and selectivity towards E coli Importantly synergy with polymyxin B was also maintained for the lead analogue

challenge to healthcare systems Although several therapeutic interventions are successfully utilized for treating epilepsy they can merely provide symptom relief but cannot exert diseasemodifying effect Therefore it is of urgent need to explore other potential mechanism to develop a novel approach to delay the epileptic progression Since approximately 30 years ago histone deacetylases HDACs the versatile epigenetic regulators responsible for gene transcription via binding histones or nonhistone substrates have grabbed considerable attention in drug discovery There are also substantial evidences supporting that aberrant expressions andactivities of HDAC isoforms are reported in epilepsy and HDAC inhibitors HDACi have been successfully utilized for therapeutic purposes in this condition However the specific mechanisms underlying the role of HDACs in epileptic progression have not been fully understood Herein we reviewed the basic information of HDACs summarized the recent findings associated with the roles of diverse HDAC subunits in epilepsy and discussed the potential regulatory mechanisms by which HDACs affected the development of epilepsy Additionally we also provided a brief discussion on the potential of HDACs as promising therapeutic targets for epilepsy treatment serving as a valuable reference for basic study and clinical translation in epilepsy field

the field of drug discovery for its significance in cancer progression as well as its difficulties in being targeted as an undruggable protein KRAS regulates downstream signaling pathways through proteinprotein interactions whereas many interaction partners of KRAS remain unknown RESULTS We developed a workflow to computationally predict and experimentally validate the potential KRASinteracting proteins based on the interaction mode of KRAS and its known binding partners We extracted 17 KRASinteracting motifs from all experimentally determined KRAScontaining protein complexes as queries to identify proteins containing fragments structurally similar to the queries in the human protein structure database using our inhouse proteinprotein interaction prediction method PPIMiner Finally out of the 78 predicted potential interacting proteins of KRAS 10 were selected for experimental validation including BRAF a previously reported interacting protein which served as the positive control in our validation experiments Additionally a known peptide that binds to KRAS KRpep2d was also used as a positive control The predicted interacting motifs of these 10 proteins were synthesized to perform biolayer interferometry assays with 4 out of 10 exhibiting binding affinities to KRAS and the strongest GRB10 was selected for further validation Additionally the interaction between GRB10 RAPH domain and KRAS was confirmed via immunofluorescence and coimmunoprecipitation CONCLUSIONS These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our workflow in predicting potential interacting proteins for KRAS and deepen the understanding of KRASdriven tumor mechanisms and the development of therapeutic strategies  2024 The Authors DOI 101186s1291502402067w PMCID PMC11575137

heart disease may eventually lead to heart failure a leading cause of mortality in diabetic individuals The lack of effective treatments for diabetesinduced heart failure may result from a failure to address the underlying pathological processes including chronic lowgrade inflammation Previous studies have reported that lipoxin A4 LXA4 known to promote resolution of inflammation attenuates diabetesinduced atherosclerosis but its impact on diabetic hearts has not been sought Thus we aimed to determine whether LXA4 therapeutic treatment attenuates diabetesinduced cardiac pathology METHODS Sixweekold male apolipoprotein Edeficient ApoE mice were followed for 16 weeks after injection of streptozotocin STZ 55 mgkgday ip for 5 days to induce type1 diabetes T1DM Treatment with LXA4 5 \u03bcgkg ip or vehicle 002 ethanol ip was administered twice weekly for the final 6 weeks One week before endpoint echocardiography was performed within a subset of mice from each group At the end of the study mice were euthanized with sodium pentobarbital 100 mgkg ip and hearts were collected for ex vivo analysis including histological assessment gene expression profiling by realtime PCR and protein level measurement by western blot RESULTS As expected diabetic mice showed a significant elevation in plasma glycated hemoglobin HbA1c and glucose levels along with reduced body weight Vehicletreated diabetic mice exhibited increased cardiac inflammation macrophage content and an elevated ratio of M1like to M2like macrophage markers In addition myocardial fibrosis cardiomyocytes apoptosis and hypertrophy at the genetic level were evident with echocardiography revealing early signs of left ventricular LV diastolic dysfunction Treatment with LXA4 ameliorated diabetesinduced cardiac inflammation proinflammatory macrophage polarization and cardiac remodeling especially myocardial fibrosis and cardiomyocytes apoptosis with ultimate improvement in cardiac function Of note this improvement was independent of glucose control CONCLUSIONS These findings demonstrated that LXA4 treatment attenuated the extent of cardiac inflammation in diabetic hearts resulting in limited cardiac remodeling and improved LV diastolic function This supports further exploration of LXA4based therapy for the management of diabetic heart disease The recent development of stable LXA4 mimetics holds potential as a novel strategy to treat cardiac dysfunction in diabetes paving the way for innovative and more effective therapeutic strategies  2024 The Authors DOI 101186s1293302402501x PMCID

methods based on chemogenomic properties of drugs and target proteins have pushed this prediction performance improvement to a new level these methods are still difficult to adapt to novel structures Alternatively largescale biological and pharmacological data provide new ways to accelerate drugtarget interaction prediction METHODS Here we propose DrugMAN a deep learning model for predicting drugtarget interaction by integrating multiplex heterogeneous functional networks with a mutual attention network MAN DrugMAN uses a graph attention networkbased integration algorithm to learn networkspecific lowdimensional features for drugs and target proteins by integrating four drug networks and seven geneprotein networks collected by a certain screening conditions respectively DrugMAN then captures interaction information between drug and target representations by a mutual attention network to improve drugtarget prediction RESULTS DrugMAN achieved the best performance compared with cheminformationbased methods SVM RF DeepPurpose and networkbased deep learing methods DTINet and NeoDT in four different scenarios especially in realworld scenarios Compared with SVM RF deepurpose DTINet and NeoDT DrugMAN showed the smallest decrease in AUROC AUPRC and F1Score from warmstart to Bothcold scenarios This result is attributed to DrugMANs learning from heterogeneous data and indicates that DrugMAN has a good generalization ability Taking together DrugMAN spotlights heterogeneous information to mine drugtarget interactions and can be a powerful tool for drug discovery and

their practical utility In this study we introduce a novel deep learning method CPIScore which leverages the capabilities of Transformer and Graph Convolutional Networks GCN to enhance the prediction of proteinligand binding affinity CPIScore utilizes the Transformer architecture to capture comprehensive global contexts of protein and ligand sequences while the GCN component effectively extracts local features from small molecular graphs Our results demonstrate that CPIScore surpasses both traditional machine learning and other deep learning models in accuracy achieving a Pearsons r of 074 on our test set Furthermore CPIScore has been validated across multiple targets proving its ability to discern inhibitors from a diverse compound library with high enrichment rates Notably when applied to a generated focused library of compounds CPIScore successfully identified six potent smallmolecule inhibitors of ATR which were tested experimentally and four small molecules exhibited inhibitory activity below ten nanomoles These results highlight CPIScores potential to significantly streamline and enhance the efficiency of drug discovery processes DOI 101021acsjcim4c01175 PMID 39563077", "1

arising from the concerted metabolism of the human host and the intestinal microbiota and are important for digestion energy homeostasis and metabolic regulation While diurnal variation has been demonstrated in the enterohepatic circulation and the gut microbiota existing human data are poorly resolved and the influence of the host circadian system has not been determined Using entrained laboratory protocols we demonstrate robust daily rhythms in the circulating bile acid pool in healthy male participants We identify temporal relationships between bile acids and plasma lipids and show that these relationships are lost following sleep deprivation We also highlight that bile acid rhythmicity is predominantly lost when environmental timing cues are held constant Here we show that the environment is a stronger determinant of these temporal dynamics than the intrinsic circadian system of the host This has significance for the intimate relationship between circadian timing and

antipsychotic drugs APDs among SCZ patients presents a significant challenge for clinicians in determining the most effective medication In this study we investigated the biological markers and established a predictive model for APD response based on a largescale genomewide association study using 3269 Chinese schizophrenia patients Each participant underwent an 8week treatment regimen with one of five monoAPDs olanzapine risperidone aripiprazole quetiapine or amisulpride By dividing the response into ordinal groups of high medium and low we mitigated the bias of unclear treatment outcome and identified three novel significantly associated genetic loci in or near CDH12 WDR11 and ELAVL2 Additionally we developed predictive models of response to each specific APDs with accuracies ranging from 795 to 980 In sum we established an effective method to predict schizophrenia patients response to APDs across three categories integrating novel biomarkers to guide personalized medicine

though the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood In this study we focused on two polysaccharides and one oligosaccharide which were extracted enzymatically from Ulva prolifera and named as

PR1 displayed moderate antiviral activity However in IFNdeficient Vero cells PR1 proved ineffective suggesting that PR1 might exert antiviral effects through type I interferon A significant finding of this study is that PR1 is capable of entering cells in an energydependent manner a characteristic previously undocumented Moreover PRs were observed to activate the intracellular STING signaling

suppressing liver Yang dispelling wind and clearing collaterals Our groups previous experimental studies have proved that GE has therapeutic effect on cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury CIRI Ding et al 2022 However the active components of GE in treating CIRI remain unclear and require further research PURPOSE The purpose of this paper was to explore the potential effective components of GE improving CIRI based on the Spectrumeffect correlation Zebrafish model was used for verification in vivo experimental MATERIALS AND METHODS First the absorption components and metabolites of GE in rat serum were identified using ultrahigh performance liquid chromatographyquadrupole timeofflight tandem mass spectrometry UHPLCQTOFMS Second pharmacodynamic indexes were determined by ELISA kit method and the effecttime curve of each pharmacodynamic indexes was established The potential compounds were screened using the statistical method of grey correlation between pharmacodynamic indicator and component response Finally the zebrafish CIRI model was successfully established and the in vivo effect of the active components of GE was verified intuitively RESULTS 45 chemical components were detected in GE A total of 87 active components in serum of GE were identified including 25 prototype components and 62 metabolites GE can improve CIRI by regulating the levels of interleukin6 IL6 interleukin1\u03b2 IL1\u03b2 and tumor necrosis factor\u03b1 TNF\u03b1 MDA levels and SOD levels It was found that phydroxy benzaldehyde PHB phydroxybenzyl alcohol PHBA and gastrodin GA of GE were the possibly main active components by grey correlation statistics The in vivo experiments of zebrafish model showed that PHB PHBA and GA have the ability to ameliorate cerebral thrombosis by regulation of oxidative stress and apoptosis CONCLUSIONS The potential active components of GE on CIRI were initially excavated using UHPLCQTOFMSMS pharmacodynamics and in vivo experiments of zebrafish model It makes up for the disadvantages of separate research on chemical components and pharmacodynamics and reflects the material basis of pharmacodynamics more objectively It has provided theoretical basis for further quality evaluation and scientific foundation for rational drug using of GE in clinical Copyright  2024 Elsevier GmbH All rights reserved DOI 101016jphymed2024156211 PMID 39561661 Conflict

in the airway epithelia CFTR helps control optimal hydration of the airways a crucial requirement for healthy lungs CFTR modulators have recently been approved as an effective treatment option for many genetic variants of CF The epithelial sodium channel ENaC unlike CFTR which is secretory is an absorptive pathway and therefore its inhibition is an alternative and potentially complementary approach to aid hydration of the airways Due to the adverse effect of ENaC inhibition in the kidney we as have several others focused on the design and synthesis of novel ENaC inhibitors for direct delivery to the airways via inhalation A new series of ENaC inhibitors is described wherein the wellestablished pyrazine core of firstgeneration inhibitors was replaced with a pyrrolopyrazine Aiming for high retention at the surface of the lung following inhalation optimisation of this template focused on significantly increasing polarity to minimize passive cellular permeability The resulting optimized clinical candidate ETD001 demonstrates potent inhibition of ENaC 59 nM prolonged retention in the airways of rats 13  of the delivered dose retained after 6h following intratracheal

calciumindependent activity in contrast to the other two major types secreted phospholipase A2 sPLA2 and cytosolic phospholipase A2 cPLA2 which both require calcium for their enzymatic activity Adenosine triphosphate ATP has been reported to allosterically activate iPLA2 and this has now been verified with a lipidomicsbased mixedmicelle assay but its mechanism of action has been unknown Hydrogendeuterium exchange mass spectrometry HDXMS was employed to identify ATP interaction peptide regions located within the ankyrin repeat domain at which ATP interacts Molecular dynamics simulations revealed the mechanism by which ATP binds to its site and the main residues that interact Sitedirected mutagenesis was used to verify the importance of these residues in the role of ATP in regulating iPLA2 activity Importantly calcium was found to abolish the enhancing regulatory function of ATP and to promote the inhibitory activity by calmodulin Given previous evidence that calcium does not bind directly to iPLA2 its effect appears to be indirect via association with ATP andor calmodulin Using HDXMS we found that calmodulin interacts with the N terminus peptide region of iPLA2

equally Human immunodeficiency virus 1 HIV1 infection remains a global health concern with nearly 30 million people on antiretroviral ARV treatment Integrase strandtransfer inhibitors INSTIs that block HIV1 integrase are crucial components of firstline combination ARV therapies recommended in most international guidelines and have significantly improved HIV1 treatment due to their efficacy and safety This study evaluates potential offtarget effects of INSTIs on recombinase activating genes RAG1 and RAG2 which are essential for adaptive immune system function We performed a comprehensive assessment of the offtarget effects of clinically approved INSTIs on RAG activity utilizing both biochemical and cellular assays We purified the first catalytically active recombinant human core RAG1RAG2 complex and tested it in the presence of the cofactor human HMGB1 protein for the gelbased biochemical RAG DNA cleavage assay Additionally we optimized an extrachromosomal VDJ recombination cellular assay using murine mCherrycore RAG1 fulllength murine mCherryRAG2 and a plasmid substrate green fluorescent protein GFP reporter system transfecting them into cells in the absence or presence of inhibitors This setup enabled highthroughput analysis of VDJ recombination for multiple compounds in a doseresponse manner via flow cytometry Physiologically relevant concentrations of INSTIs were examined for their potential impact on RAG activity and VDJ recombination with approved INSTIs showing minimal to no effects on recombinase activity Consequently the findings support the continued use of INSTIs in HIV1 treatment without substantial concern for adverse effects on VDJ recombination and immune system functionIMPORTANCEINSTIs are a crucial component of antiretroviral treatments for HIV1 infection This study provides a careful and thorough analysis of the impact of approved INSTIs on recombinase activating gene RAG1 and RAG2 activity which plays a pivotal role in the adaptive immune system The concentrations tested were derived from several clinical studies and accounted for the maximum free fraction of the drug available in patients This approach ensures that our findings are directly applicable to clinical scenarios by providing meaningful insights into the potential drug side effects in patients We developed biochemical and cellular assays to measure the impact of INSTIs on RAG activity All tested INSTIs did not inhibit RAG at supratherapeutic concentrations in the RAG1RAG2 biochemical cleavage and cellular VDJ recombination assays Our assessment supports the

United States Free energy perturbation FEP methodologies have become commonplace methods for modeling potency in hittolead and lead optimization stages of drug discovery The conformational states of the initial poses of compounds for FEP calculations are often set up by alignment to a cocrystal structure ligand but it is not clear if this method provides the best result for all proteins or all ligands Not only are ligand conformational states potential variables in modeling compound potency in FEP but also the selection of crystallographic water molecules for inclusion in the FEP input structures can impact FEP models Here we report the results of FEP calculations using FEP from Schr\u00f6dinger and starting from maximum common substructure alignment and docked poses generated with an array of docking methodologies As a benchmark data set we use monoacylglycerol lipase MAGL an important clinical drug target in cancer malignancy neurological diseases and metabolic disorders and a set of 17 MAGL inhibitors We found a large variation among FEP correlations to experimental IC50 values depending on the method used to generate the input pose and that the inclusion of ligandbased information in the docking process with some methods increases the correlation between FEP free energies and IC50 values Upon analysis of the initial poses we found that the differences in FEP correlations stemmed from rotation around a tertiary amide bond as well as translation of the compound toward the more hydrophobic side of the MAGL pocket FEP estimation improved across all pose modeling methods when hydrogen bond constraint information was added However simple maximum common substructure alignment in the presence of all crystallographic water molecules outperformed all other methods in correlation between estimated and experimental IC50 values Taken together these findings suggest that pose selection and crystallographic water inclusion greatly impact how well FEP estimated IC50 values align with experimental IC50 values and that modelers should benchmark a few different pose generation methodologies and different water inclusion strategies for their hittolead and lead optimization drug discovery projects DOI 101021acsjcim4c01223 PMID 39560439", "1 Immun Inflamm Dis 2024 Nov1211e70054 doi 101002iid370054 Schistosomiasis Chemotherapy Chemoprevention and

AlBeheira Egypt BACKGROUND Schistosomiasis is a major human disease of public health importance Freshwater snails serving as intermediary hosts and human interaction with surface water tainted by feces or urine are both necessary components of the transmission cycle Schistosoma haematobium Schistosoma mansoni and Schistosoma japonicum are the primary pathogen species Over 250 million individuals are infected globally according to the World Health Organization causing significant morbidity and an estimated loss of 19 million disabilityadjusted life years a number that is probably underestimated Immunological protection is slowly built up through complex immunological systems although innate factors also play a role Chronic schistosomiasis affects mainly individuals residing in poor rural area Vaccination is considered as one of the most sustainable options for the control of any pathogen but schistosomiasis vaccine for humans or animals is not available till now despite the discovery of numerous potentially promising schistosome vaccine antigens OBJECTIVE To provide an overview of the schistosomiasis chemotherapy chemoprevention and vaccines history and progress DESIGN Review article DATA SOURCES PubMed ISI Web of Science Science Direct and the World Health Organization database CONCLUSION Favorably praziquantel PZQ is a medication with excellent chemopreventive treatment compliance Due to the extensive usage of PZQ there is a great deal of debate surrounding the emergence of drug resistance PZQ is effective against all species of schistosomes schistosomiasis prevalence has remained largely unaffected due to reinfection in high transmission areas and growing juvenile worms that were not affected by the drug even though the need for a schistosomiasis vaccine is even more pressing  2024 The Authors Immunity Inflammation and Disease published by John Wiley  Sons Ltd DOI 101002iid370054 PMCID PMC11574878 PMID 39560407 Indexed for MEDLINE Conflict of

brain tumors that present significant challenges for research and treatment due to their complex microenvironment and tissue structure Recent discovery of tumor microtubes TMs has provided new insights into how highgrade gliomas develop in the brain and resist treatment TMs are unique ultralong and highly functional membrane protrusions that form multicellular networks and play crucial roles in glioma invasiveness drug resistance recurrence and heterogeneity This review focuses on the different roles that TMs play in glioma cell communication material transport and tumor cell behavior Specifically nonconnecting TMs primarily promote glioma invasiveness likely related to their role in enhancing cell motility On the other hand interconnecting TMs form functional and communication networks by connecting with surrounding astrocytes and neurons thereby promoting glioma malignancy We summarize the factors that influence the formation of TMs in gliomas and current strategies targeting TMs As the understanding of TMs advances we are closer to uncovering whether they might be the longsought Achilles heel of treatmentresistant gliomas By delving deeper into TMs

diseases however its relationship with the apolipoprotein E APOE \u03b54 allele has not been well characterized METHODS Participants clinically diagnosed with Alzheimers disease or mild cognitive impairment ADMCI frontotemporal dementia Parkinsons disease or cerebrovascular disease were stratified by the presence of the APOE \u03b54 allele Volumetric magnetic resonance imaging plasma amyloidtauneurodegeneration biomarkers and cognitive performance were quantified RESULTS Across all diagnostic groups Hcy was associated with lower brain parenchymal fraction and greater neurofilament light chain in APOE \u03b54 noncarriers only In ADMCI Hcy was associated with phosphorylated tau 217 in APOE \u03b54 noncarriers but not in carriers Exploratory analyses revealed interactions between Hcy and APOE \u03b54 on memory and visuospatial function DISCUSSION Hcy may contribute to neurodegeneration depending on the presence of the APOE \u03b54 allele and specific disease processes Trials on vitamin B12 supplementation may consider stratifying by APOE genotype Highlights Homocysteine Hcy was associated with neurodegenerative biomarkers across disease groups Relationships with Hcy were predominantly found in apolipoprotein E APOE \u03b54 noncarriers In Alzheimers disease associations between Hcy and phosphorylated tau 217 were found in APOE \u03b54 noncarriers only Significant

common to both traditional Chinese medicine and culinary applications and it can potentially alleviate metabolicassociated fatty liver disease MAFLD triggered by a highfat diet HFD PURPOSE This research aims to investigate the impact and underlying mechanisms of MST in ameliorating MAFLD caused by an HFD METHODS UHPLCQOrbitrapMSMS was used to determine the constituents of MST and to evaluate its effects on MAFLD mouse models Transcriptomics network pharmacology and bioinformatics analysis including Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis were utilized to further clarify the mechanisms by which MST acts on MAFLD The experimental methods included ELISA real time quantitative PCR RTqPCR Western blot immunohistochemistry molecular docking and metabolomics Transcriptomics was integrated with metabolomics to find correlations between differentially expressed genes and metabolites and crucial genes were validated through RTqPCR RESULTS A total of 23 components of MST were identified The formulation was found to alleviate metabolic disorders obesity insulin resistance inflammation and oxidative stress in mice with MAFLD The findings indicate that MST promoted autophagy by suppressing phosphorylation in the PI3KAKTmTOR pathway and enhancing lipid management in the livers of MAFLD mice CONCLUSION MST could effectively improve lipid metabolism disorders and liver lipid deposition in MAFLD mice and its mechanism might be related to regulating the PI3KAKTmTOR pathway to improve autophagy  2024 Wang et al DOI 102147DDDTS478072 PMCID

Astana Kazakhstan 3AlFarabi Kazakh National University Almaty Kazakhstan BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Limited information is available regarding the distribution of increasing pharmaceutical expenditures within large representative samples of national populations globally The aim was to investigate the distribution of pharmaceutical costs in outpatient treatment and analyze the primary characteristics of users of expensive drugs within the healthcare system of Kazakhstan METHODS This study utilized data from the Information System for Outpatient Drug Supply which includes nationally representative data from all regions of Kazakhstan covering both rural and urban populations The key explanatory variables in this study included age gender number of prescribed medications disease categories based on ICD10 codes and insurance coverage status These variables were selected to capture demographic clinical and healthcare access factors influencing prescription drug costs In total 22 million people who were prescribed outpatient medications were included Highcost users HCUs were characterized as individuals whose prescription drug expenses ranked within the highest 5 RESULTS The distribution of pharmaceutical costs exhibits significant discrepancy with 5 of the population receiving prescription drugs covered by the state budget and social medical insurance fund contributing to nearly threequarters of all costs Notably these HCUs tended to be younger than lowcost drug users HCUs on average consumed a greater quantity of medications compared to nonHCUs Among children the top diseases contributing to high costs were rare hereditary diseases and malignancies while in adults cancer and diabetes were the primary cost drivers CONCLUSION There is a concentration of public drug program spending within a small percentage of beneficiaries with high drug costs in Kazakhstan This discovery offers valuable insights for shaping policies tailored to this specific population aiming to mitigate escalating costs and enhance the optimal use of medications Plain Language Summary The pronounced skewness in the consumption of reimbursed outpatient drugs within the healthcare system of the Republic of Kazakhstan highlights the need for targeted cost containment strategies in addition to broader measures such as price regulation and adjustments to reimbursement lists that impact the general population The highest average costs in the highcost group are observed in children under 5 years of age Costs associated with chronic diseases diabetes and others rank in the top three while when assessing costs in the highcost user group rare inherited diseases and cancer have a significant impact  2024 Nazarbayev et al DOI 102147CEORS470632 PMCID PMC11572462 PMID 39559690 Conflict of

University Bangkok Thailand BACKGROUND Acanthamoeba spp is a waterborne opportunistic protozoan that can cause amebic keratitis and granulomatous amebic encephalitis Knema retusa is a native tree in Malaysia and its extracts possess a broad range of biological activities Niosomes are nonionic surfactantbased vesicle formations and suggest a future targeted drug delivery system Copolymer micelle polyethylene glycolblockpoly\u025bcaprolactone PEGbPCL is also a key constituent of niosome and supports high stability and drug efficacy To establish Knema retusa extract KRe loading in diverse nanocarriers via niosome PEGbPCL micelle and their combination and to study the effect of all types of nanoparticles NPs on Acanthamoeba viability adherent ability elimination of adherence and cytotoxicity METHODS In this study we characterized niosomes PEGbPCL and their combination loaded with KRe and tested the effect of these NPs on Acanthamoeba triangularis stages KReloaded PEGbPCL KReloaded niosome and KReloaded PEGbPCL plus niosome were synthesized and characterized regarding particle size and charge yield encapsulation efficiency EE and drug loading content DLC The effect of these KReloaded NPs on trophozoite and cystic forms of A triangularis was assessed through assays of minimal inhibitory concentration MIC using trypan blue exclusion to determine the viability The effect of KReloaded NPs was also determined on A triangularis trophozoite for 2472 h Additionally the antiadhesion activity of the KReloaded niosome on trophozoites was also performed on a 96well plate Cytotoxicity activity of KReloaded NPs was assessed on VERO and HaCaT cells using MTT assay RESULTS KReloaded niosome demonstrated a higher yielded 8793  603 at 286 nm UVVis detection and exhibited a larger size 1993  2998 nm and DLC 1963  184 compared to KReloaded PEGbPCL 452  1007 nm and 215  025 The EE  of KReloaded niosome was 6367  404 which was significantly lower than that of the combination of PEGbPCL and niosome 7967  208 However the particle charge of these NPs was similar 282  368 mV and 285  488 respectively Additionally KReloaded niosome and KReloaded PEGbPCL plus niosome exhibited a lower MIC at 24 h 025 mgmL inhibiting 90100 of Acanthamoeba trophozoites which lasted 72 h KReloaded niosome affected adherence by around 4060 at 0125025 mgmL and removed Acanthamoeba adhesion on the surface by about 90 at 05 mgmL Cell viability of VERO and HaCaT cells treated with 0125 mgmL of KReloaded niosome and KReloaded PEGbPCL plus niosome exceeded 80 CONCLUSION Indeed niosome and niosome plus PEGbPCL were suitable nanocarrierloaded KRe and they had a greater nanoparticle property to test with high activities against A triangularis on the reduction of adherence ability and demonstration of its low toxicity to VERO and HaCaT cells 2024 Chimplee et al DOI 107717peerj18452 PMCID PMC11572385 PMID 39559326 Indexed for MEDLINE Conflict of interest

biloba extract is reported to have therapeutic effects on agingrelated disorders However the specific component responsible for this biological function and its mechanism of action remain largely unknown This study finds that Ginkgetin an active ingredient of Ginkgo biloba extract can alleviate cellular senescence and improve pathologies in multiple tissues of aging mice To reveal the molecular mechanism of Ginkgetins antiaging effect a graph convolutional networkbased drug ontarget pathway prediction algorithm for prediction is employed The results indicate that the cGASSTING pathway may be a potential target for Ginkgetin Subsequent cell biological and biophysical data confirmed that Ginkgetin directly binds to the carboxyterminal domain of STING protein thereby inhibiting STING activation and signal transduction Furthermore in vivo pharmacodynamic data showed that Ginkgetin effectively alleviates systemic inflammation in Trex1 mice and inhibits the abnormally activated STING signaling in aging mouse model In summary this study utilizing an artificial intelligence algorithm combined with pharmacological methods confirms STING serves as a critical target for Ginkgetin in alleviating inflammation and senescence Importantly this study elucidates the specific component and molecular mechanism underlying the antiaging effect of Ginkgo biloba extract providing a robust theoretical basis for its therapeutic use  2024 The Authors Advanced Science published by WileyVCH GmbH DOI 101002advs202407222 PMID 39558862", "1 J Biomol Struct Dyn 2024

understanding biological processes and disease mechanisms contributing significantly to advances in protein engineering and drug discovery The accurate determination of binding affinities essential for decoding PPIs faces challenges due to the substantial time and financial costs involved in experimental and theoretical methods This situation underscores the urgent need for more effective and precise methodologies for predicting binding affinity Despite the abundance of research on PPI modeling the field of quantitative binding affinity prediction remains underexplored mainly due to a lack

Sciences Saarland University 66123 Saarbr\u00fccken Germany In recent years machine learning has transformed many aspects of the drug discovery process including small molecule design for which the prediction of bioactivity is an integral part Leveraging structural information about the interactions between a small molecule and its protein target has great potential for downstream machine learning scoring approaches but is fundamentally limited by the accuracy with which proteinligand complex structures can be predicted in a reliable and automated fashion With the goal of finding practical approaches to generating useful kinaseinhibitor complex geometries for downstream machine learning scoring approaches we present a kinasecentric docking benchmark assessing the performance of different classes of docking and pose selection strategies to assess how well experimentally observed binding modes are recapitulated in a realistic crossdocking scenario The assembled benchmark data set focuses on the wellstudied protein kinase family and comprises a subset of 589 protein structures cocrystallized with 423 ATPcompetitive ligands We find that the docking methods biased by the cocrystallized ligand utilizing shape overlap with or without maximum common substructure matching are more successful in recovering binding poses than standard physicsbased docking alone Also docking into multiple structures significantly increases the chance of generating a low rootmeansquare deviation RMSD docking pose Docking utilizing an approach that combines all three methods Posit into structures with the most similar cocrystallized ligands according to the maximum common substructure MCS proved to be the most efficient way to reproduce binding poses achieving a success rate of 704 across all included systems The studied docking and pose selection strategies which utilize the OpenEye Toolkits were implemented into pipelines of the KinoML framework allowing automated and reliable proteinligand complex generation for future downstream machine learning tasks Although focused on protein kinases we believe that the general findings can also be transferred to other protein families

preclinical experimental studies In the context of pulmonary fibrosis microcomputed tomography \u00b5CT and histology are wellestablished and complementary tools for assessing in animal models disease progression and response to treatment \u00b5CT offers dynamic realtime insights into disease evolution and the effects of therapies while histology provides a detailed microscopic examination of lung tissue Here we present a semiautomatic pipeline that integrates these readouts by matching individual \u00b5CT volume slices with the corresponding histological sections effectively linking densitometric data with Ashcroft score measurements METHODS The tool first geometrically aligns the vertical axis of the \u00b5CT volume with the cutting plane used to prepare the histological sample Then focusing on the left lung it computes the affine registration that identifies the \u00b5CT coronal slice that best matches the histological section Finally quantitative \u00b5CT imaging parameters are extracted from the selected slice In a proofofconcept test the tool was applied to a bleomycininduced mouse model of lung fibrosis RESULTS The proposed approach demonstrated high accuracy and time effectiveness in matching \u00b5CT and histological sections minimizing manual intervention with an overall success rate of 95 and reduced time required to align \u00b5CT and histological data from 40 to 5 min Significant correlations were found between quantitative data derived from \u00b5CT and histology data CONCLUSIONS The precise combination of microscopic exvivo information with 3D invivo data enhances the accuracy and representativeness of tissue analysis and provides a structural context for omic studies serving as the foundation for a multilayer platform By facilitating a detailed and objective view of disease progression and treatment response this approach has the potential to accelerate the development of effective therapies for lung fibrosis  2024

Chengdu 610000 China pengbo2019cdutcmeducn Avascular necrosis of the femoral head ANFH is a progressive multifactorial and challenging clinical condition that often leads to hip dysfunction and deterioration The pathogenesis of ANFH is complex and there is no foolproof treatment strategy Although some pharmacologic and surgical treatments have been shown to improve ANFH the associated side effects and poor prognosis are of concern Therefore there is an urgent need to explore therapeutic interventions with superior efficacy and safety to improve the quality of life of patients with ANFH Salvia miltiorrhiza SM a traditional Chinese medicine with a long history is widely used for the treatment of cardiovascular and musculoskeletal diseases due to its multiple pharmacological activities However the molecular mechanism of SM for the treatment of ANFH is still unclear Therefore this study aimed to explore the potential targets and mechanisms of SM for the treatment of ANFH using network pharmacology and molecular modeling techniques By searching multiple databases we screened 52 compounds and 42 common targets involved in ANFH therapy and identified danshexinkum d cryptotanshinone tanshinone iia and dihydrotanshinlactone as key compounds Based on the proteinprotein interaction PPI network TP53 AKT1 EGFR STAT3 BCL2 IL6 and TNF were identified as core targets Subsequent enrichment analysis revealed that these targets were mainly enriched in the AGERAGE IL17 and TNF pathways which were mainly associated with inflammatory responses apoptosis and oxidative stress In addition molecular docking and 100 nanoseconds molecular dynamics MD simulations showed that the bioactive compounds of SM had excellent affinity and binding strength to the core targets Among them danshexinkum d possessed the lowest binding free energy 215874 kcalmol and  140277 kcalmol respectively for AKT1 and EGFR These results demonstrated the multicomponent multitarget and multipathway intervention mechanism of SM in the treatment of ANFH which provided theoretical basis and clues for further experimental validation and development of antiANFH drugs  2024 The Authors

The dibutyl phthalate DBP is a member of the phthalate family and is widely used as a plasticizer in daily life and production However the influence of DBP on the vascular developmental remains unclear METHODS In this study we used zebrafish as a model organism to investigate the effects of DBP on vascular development in vivo Death curves of zebrafish at different concentrations of DBP exposure and different times incubation were made firstly Zebrafish embryos after fertilization for 55 h were exposed to different concentrations of DBP solution 0 04 08 12 mgL the body length yolk sac absorption area mortality and heart rate of zebrafish were measured and the number and area of sprouting of ventral vessels were quantified by transgenic fish system Reactive oxygen species ROS in zebrafish embryos were observed by DCFHDA staining Super oxide dimutese SOD and catalase CAT were determined with ELISA kits RESULTS We found that DBP increased the oxidative stress level of zebrafish exposed to DBP and the genes related to vascular development also increased Meanwhile the activities of SOD and CAT were greatly decreased after DBP exposure In the rescue experiment we found that the antioxidant astaxanthin and the small molecule VEGF inhibitor ZM306416 can reverse the vascular dysplasia caused by DBP CONCLUSIONS DBP induced vascular developmental toxicity by enhancing oxidative stress levels activating HIF pathway and interfering with the expression of vascular developmentrelated pathways in zebrafish results in the abnormal development of the subintestinal vessels in

the most important genetic causal factor for the familial Alzheimers disease AD While most diseasecausal mutations of APP occur within the A\u03b2coding region or immediately proximal the pathological impacts of mutations in the Nterminus of APP protein which remote from the A\u03b2 sequence on neuron and synapse are still largely unknown It was recently reported a pathogenic APP Nterminal Val225Ala mutation APPV225A with clinically featuring progressive dementia and typical AD pathologies in brain In our present study we further found that APPV225A mutation alters the Nterminal structure of APP which enhances its binding affinity to tau protein and significantly increases APPmediated endocytosis Consequently APPV225A promotes the uptake of extracellular tau into SHSY5Y cells further linking the structural change in APP to intracellular tau accumulation In addition APPV225A also notably alters the liquidliquid phase separation LLPS of intracellular tau and intensified tau phosphorylation and aggregation in SHSY5Y cells Moreover APPV225A promote ADlike tau pathology and synaptic damages in human induced pluripotent stem cells hiPSCsderived neural progenitor cells and neurons as well as in hiPSCsderived human brain organoids and mouse brain which can be ameliorated by tau knockdown Proximity labeling identified several key APPV225Ainteracting proteins including HS3ST3A1 which was shown to directly regulate tau LLPS and phosphorylation These findings nicely build on our previous work on roles for APP in taurelated pathological phenotypes and further highlight the involvement of Nterminal APP as the key region for both amyloidopathy and tauopathy two aspects of AD pathogenesis and progression Our study may also provide a theoretical breakthrough for AD therapy and highlight the important hub roles of APP and making previously neglected Nterminal APP as a potential target for the discovery of novel diseasemodifying therapeutic agents against AD

the structureantitumour activity relationship was conducted After analysing a library of derivatives from the styrylquinoline and furanylvinylquinoline groups we selected the most active IC50 below 100 nM derivative 13 which contained the strongly electronwithdrawing nitro group in the furan substituent The mechanism of action of this compound was studied on cell lines that differed in their p53 protein status For this derivative both cell cycle arrest in G2M phase in both HCT 116 cell lines and S phase for U251 cell line and the induction of apoptosis up to 66 for U251 cell line were revealed These studies were then confirmed by other methods at the gene and protein levels Interestingly we observed differences in the mechanism of action depending on the presence and mutation of the p53 protein thus confirming its key role in cellular processes Incubation with derivative 13 resulted in the induction of oxidative stress and triggered a cascade of cellular defence proteins that failed in the face of such an active compound In addition the results showed an inhibition of the GLUT1 glucose transporter which is extremely important in the context of anticancer activity  2024 The

effects in different breast cancer subtypes focusing on mitochondrial dysfunction The sensitivity of different subtypes to the inhibitors was investigated with respect to DHODH expression tumorigenic and receptor status Analysis of respiratory complexes cell cycle reactive oxygen species ROS and cell differentiation were performed Four cell lines with different receptor status were included namely MCF7 MDAMB231 SKBR3 and MCF10A We showed that MCF7 and MDAMB231 cells of the subtypes ERPRHER2 and ERPRHER2 respectively were responsive to brequinar Brequinar BQR caused cell cycle arrest in the Sphase in sensitive subtypes of breast cells but induced cell differentiation only in poorly differentiated breast cells All cell subtypes showed increased generation of ROS both intracellular and mitochondrial ROS with a greater increase seen in mitochondrial ROS in response to DHODH inhibitor subsequently contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction BQR also disrupts the function of complex III in ERPR and triple negative breast cancer TNBC subtypes Collectively we have found that MDAMB231 TNBC cell was the most affected by DHODH inhibition in terms of sensitivity cell cycle arrest induction

relatively safe from a cognitive perspective however there is a lack of evidence based on neuropsychological assessments supporting this This study is the first prospective evaluation of neuropsychological outcomes associated with stereoEEGguided RFTHC in patients with focal drugresistant epilepsy METHODS This cohort study involved prospective recruitment of consecutive patients undergoing stereoEEG from 2 Australian centers A comprehensive neuropsychological assessment was administered before implantation and 3 months after RFTHC M  10451 days SD  2925 Outcomes across cognitive domains were assessed at a group level with repeated measures t tests Factorial repeated measures analyses of variance compared memory and language outcomes according to whether dominant mesial temporal lobe mTL structures were coagulated Reliable change indices RCIs were computed to explore psychometrically reliable changes at an individual level RESULTS The sample comprised 39 patients who underwent stereoEEG M  3708  967 years range  1756 years 54 female Nineteen 49 had a language dominant epileptogenic zone EZ 16 41 a nondominant EZ and 4 10 a bilateral EZ All patients underwent RFTHC with a mean of 1187 SD  682 range  229 coagulation sites Ten patients 26 had RFTHC within the dominant mTL At a group level RFTHC was not associated with a significant decline on any neuropsychological measures all comparisons p  005 Subgroup analyses revealed a decline in delayed verbal recall after RFTHC of dominant mTL structures F137  446 p  004 \u03b7p2  011 95 CI 0030 medium to large effect although it did not remain statistically significant after correction for false discovery rate No statistically significant group differences were observed on visual memory or language measures postRFTHC all comparisons p  005 RCI revealed that after RFTHC within the dominant mTL 20 of patients experienced a decline in verbal memory and 10 in visual memory By contrast 7 declined in verbal memory and 10 in visual memory postRFTHC outside the dominant mTL DISCUSSION While these findings support the current view that RFTHC is cognitively benign for most cases the results raise the question of a verbal memory decline after coagulation of the dominant mTL Individualized neuropsychological counseling before stereoEEG is essential to avoid unanticipated deficits DOI

effective therapeutic treatments The natural product Balasubramide is an eightmembered lactam compound extracted from the leaves of the Sri Lanka plant Clausena Indica and has shown antiinflammatory activities but its poor pharmacokinetic properties limit its further application for ALI In this study a compound 3C20 is discovered with improved both pharmacokinetic properties and antiinflammatory activity from a series of Balasubramide derivatives The compound 3C20 exhibits a markedly enhanced inhibitory effect against LPSinduced expressions of proinflammatory factors in mouse macrophages and human PBMCs from ALI patients and shows a preferable lung tissue distribution in mice 3C20 remarkably attenuates LPSinduced ALI through lung tissuespecific antiinflammatory actions Mechanistically a chemical proteomics study shows that 3C20 directly binds to mitochondrial VDAC1 and inhibits VDAC1 oligomerization to block mtDNA release further preventing NLRP3 inflammasome activation These findings identify 3C20 as a novel VDAC1 inhibitor with promising therapeutic potential for ALI associated with inflammation  2024 The Authors Advanced Science published by WileyVCH GmbH DOI

receptor expressed in taste receptor cells TRCs of the taste bud Recent reports have suggested the existence of an additional sweet taste signaling pathway for metabolizable saccharides that is dependent on the activity of glucose transporters especially SGLT1 also expressed in TRCs We have investigated the potential contribution of SGLT1 to glucose taste signaling in humans Concentrationresponse analysis of glucose mediated changes in membrane potential measured in Chinese hamster ovary CHO cells transiently expressing the human SGLT1 hSGLT1 yielded an EC50 value of 452 \u03bcM The SGLT inhibitor phlorizin inhibited the membrane potential response to 10 mM glucose with an IC50 of 35 \u03bcM In contrast EC50 values of 127 and 132 mM were obtained from concentrationresponse analysis of glucose taste in vehicles of water or 20 mM NaCl respectively by rapid throughput taste discrimination with human subjects Lactisole an antagonist of TAS1R2R3 at a concentration of 1 mM completely inhibited taste responses to glucose concentrations of 250 mM and below Phlorizin 02 mM and the high potency SGLT1selective inhibitor mizagliflozin 10 \u03bcM failed to inhibit glucose taste detection measured at perithreshold concentrations in the rapid throughput taste discrimination assay A YesNo experiment using the taste discrimination assay revealed that 02 mM phlorizin was discriminable from water for some subjects Taken together the results indicate that agonist activation of TAS1R2R3 is sufficient to account for all glucose taste without contribution by an alternative SGLTmediated signaling pathway Furthermore the taste of phlorizin could be a confounding variable for studies evaluating a role for SGLTs in taste Copyright  2024 Palmer et al This

Griffith University Nathan Queensland Australia Contributed equally Stressful life events and glucocorticoid stress hormones appear to increase the risk of Alzheimers disease and hasten its progression but the reasons for this remain unclear One potential explanation is that when amyloid \u03b2 A\u03b2 pathology is accumulating in the preclinical disease stage glucocorticoid receptor signalling during stressful events exacerbates cellular dysfunction caused by A\u03b2 Alternatively A\u03b2 may disrupt glucocorticoid receptor signalling To explore these possibilities we investigated whether the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone and A\u03b2 have overlapping effects on the cellular proteome and whether A\u03b2 influences canonical glucocorticoid receptor function Human olfactory neurospherederived ONS cells collected from the olfactory mucosa of six adult donors were treated with soluble A\u03b240 or A\u03b242 followed by dexamethasone Proteins were quantified by mass spectrometry After 32 h treatment A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 both induced profound changes in innate immunityrelated proteins After 72 h A\u03b242 formed widespread aggregates and induced few proteomic changes whereas A\u03b240 remained soluble and altered expression of mitochondrial and innate immunityrelated proteins ONS cells revealed overlapping impacts of A\u03b240 and dexamethasone with 23 proteins altered by both treatments For 16 proteins including eight mitochondrial proteins dexamethasone counteracted the effects of A\u03b240 For example caspase 4 and methylmalonatesemialdehyde dehydrogenase were increased by A\u03b240 and decreased by dexamethasone Consistent with this finding A\u03b240 increased but dexamethasone decreased ONS cell proliferation For seven proteins including superoxide dismutase Mn mitochondrial dexamethasone exacerbated the effects of A\u03b240 For some proteins including complement C3 the effects of dexamethasone differed depending on whether A\u03b240 was present or absent Neither A\u03b2 species influenced glucocorticoid receptor nuclear translocation Overall this study revealed that glucocorticoid receptor signalling modifies the intracellular effects of A\u00df40 counteracting some effects and exacerbating others It suggests that cellular mechanisms through which glucocorticoid receptor signalling

sirtuin proteins have been identified and are currently known to be present in organisms from all the three kingdoms of life ie bacteria archaea and eukarya Seven sirtuin proteins have been identified

derived from fruits and vegetables has shown promising results in the improvement of traumatic brain injury TBI This study aims to elucidate the therapeutic role and potential mechanisms of quercetin in TBI through systematic evaluations and network pharmacology approaches First the metaanalysis was conducted via Review Manager 54 software The metaanalysis results confirmed that quercetin could improve TBI primarily by inhibiting inflammation oxidative stress and apoptosis Subsequently targets related to quercetin and those related to TBI were extracted from drugrelated databases and diseaserelated databases respectively We found that the potential mechanism by which quercetin treats TBI is largely associated with ferroptosis as indicated by functional analysis Based on this we identified 29 ferroptosisrelated genes FRGs associated with quercetin and TBI and then performed Gene Ontology GO and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes KEGG enrichment analysis using the DAVID database The functional enrichment results revealed that these FRGs mainly involve the HIF1 signaling pathway IL17 signaling pathway and PI3KAkt signaling pathway Subsequently we constructed a PPI

Notably no clinically approved drugs specifically target EV71 The EV71 2A protease 2Apro a cysteine protease produced by the virus is essential for the virus replication and has a significant impact on the functioning of host cells Thus it presents a valuable target for the discovery of antiviral medications In this study based on the monomers and their derivatives in the Library of Traditional Chinese Medicine TCM we performed virtual screening and biological experiments We identified a derivative of a traditional herbal monomer Etoposide commonly isolated from the roots and rhizomes of Podophyllum spp Etoposide inhibited replication of EV71 A B C and CVA16 viruses in a concentrationdependent manner in a variety of cell lines with minimal cytotoxicity Furthermore both molecular dynamics simulations and sitedirected mutagenesis assays revealed that Etoposide inhibited the activity of the EV71 2A protease by mainly binding to two residues Y89 and P107 The findings indicate that Etoposide serves as a promising inhibitor of the EV71 2Apro demonstrating strong antiviral properties and positioning itself as a formidable candidate for clinical trials against EV71IMPORTANCEWe first used a drug screening approach focused on monomeric compounds and their derivatives from traditional Chinese medicine to identify an EV71 2Apro inhibitorEtoposide We then performed biological experiments to validate that Etoposide suppresses the replication of the EV71 virus in a concentrationdependent manner with minimal cytotoxicity to various cell lines Remarkably it shows inhibitory activity against EV71 A B C and CVA16 suggesting that Etoposide may be a potential broadspectrum inhibitor We revealed a novel mechanism that Etoposide inhibits EV71 proliferation by targeting 2Apro and the interactions with Y89 and P107 are of great importance The findings suggest that Etoposide serves as a promising inhibitor of EV71 2Apro demonstrating significant antiviral properties It

Biochemistry  Molecular Biology Medical University of South Carolina Charleston SC 29425 USA Overdose of acetaminophen APAP produces fulminant hepatic necrosis The underlying mechanism of APAP hepatotoxicity involves mitochondrial dysfunction including mitochondrial oxidant stress and the onset of mitochondrial permeability transition MPT Reactive oxygen species ROS play an important role in APAPinduced hepatotoxicity and iron is a critical catalyst for ROS formation This review summarizes the role of mitochondrial ROS formation in APAP hepatotoxicity and further focuses on the role of iron Normally hepatocytes take up Fe3transferrin bound to transferrin receptors via endocytosis Concentrated into lysosomes the controlled release of iron is required for the mitochondrial biosynthesis of heme and nonheme ironsulfur clusters After APAP overdose the toxic metabolite NAPQI damages lysosomes causing excess iron release and the mitochondrial uptake of Fe2 by the mitochondrial calcium uniporter MCU NAPQI also inhibits mitochondrial respiration to promote ROS formation including H2O2 with which Fe2 reacts to form highly reactive OH through the Fenton reaction OH in turn causes lipid peroxidation the formation of toxic aldehydes induction of the MPT and ultimately cell death Fe2 also facilitates protein nitration Targeting pathways of mitochondrial iron movement and consequent irondependent mitochondrial ROS formation is a promising strategy to intervene against APAP hepatotoxicity in a clinical setting DOI 103390livers4030024 PMCID PMC11567147 PMID

quinazoline compounds 5ar was prepared METHODS As a reference four cancer cell linesHCT116 HePG2 Hela and MCF7and sorafenib SOR were used to assess the novel motifs in vitro anticancer efficacy The most cytotoxic compounds were tested in a VEGFR2 suppressive test and flow cytometric test Docking analysis was done to the three novel motifs RESULTS Compound 5d showed the best antitumor activity of the tested compounds with IC50 609 239 894 and 481 \u03bcM in succession In addition compound 5h revealed a potent anticancer effect against HCT116 and HePG2 with IC50 589 and 674 \u03bcM respectively Also compound 5p exhibited very strong activity against HCT116 HePG2  MCF7 with IC50 832 972 and 799 respectively Compound 5p had the highest inhibition against VEGFR2 with an IC50 of 0117 \u03bcM in contrast to 0069 \u03bcM for SOR According to flow cytometric testing the most effective VEGFR2 inhibitory agent 5p was shown to suppress the G1S cell population in MCF7 cells Docking analysis confirmed that the three novel motifs could bind to the VEGFR2 enzymes binding region like the cocrystallized ligand SOR did CONCLUSION The enzyme inhibitory test of compound 5p showed that it is the most potent hybrid that caused MCF7 cells to undergo apoptosis and generated a G1S cell cycle arrest Confirmation of the obtained results was done with the aid of the docking study which showed that the three motifs might adhere to the enzymes major active sites and the results were in good accordance with the experimental VEGFR2 inhibitory results We can conclude that the new quinazoline compounds 5ar could be used as candidates for development of more efficient anticancer inhibitors  2024 AlSanea et al DOI 102147DDDTS490930 PMCID PMC11568772 PMID 39554760 Indexed for MEDLINE Conflict

Engineering KAIST Daejeon 34141 Republic of Korea The drug discovery pipelines require enormous time and cost albeit their infamously high risk of failures Reducing such risk has therefore been the utmost goal in the process Recently natural products NPs in traditional oriental medicine TOM have come into the spotlight for their efficacy and safety supported throughout the history Not only that with the everincreasing repository of various biological datasets many datadriven in silico approaches have also been extensively studied for better efficient search and testing However TOMbased datasets lack information on recently prevalent diseases while experimental datasets are prone to provide target spaces that are too large Adequate combination of both approaches can therefore fill in each others blanks In this study we introduce NaCTR an in silico discovery pipeline that achieves such integration to suggest NPsderived drug candidates for a given disease First phenotypes and disease genes for the disease are identified in literature and public databases Secondly a pool of potentially therapeutic NPs are identified based on both TOMbased phenotype records and compoundgene interaction datasets Lastly the compounds contained in the NPs are further screened for toxicity and pharmacokinetic properties We use the Parkinsons disease as the case study to test the NaCTR pipeline Through the pipeline we propose glutathione and four other compounds as novel drug candidates We further highlight the finding with literature support As the first to effectively combine data from ancient and recent repositories the NaCTR pipeline can be a novel pipeline that can be applied successfully to any other diseases  2024 The Authors DOI 101016jcsbj202410035 PMCID PMC11564001 PMID

Hence the identification and development of novel drug targets and biomarkers for JIA are imperative for enhancing treatment efficacy METHODS We employed twosample Mendelian randomization MR analysis to investigate the causal effects of plasma proteins on JIA Additionally colocalization bulk RNAseq and singlecell RNAseq analyses were conducted to further investigate and validate the potential of candidate proteins as drug targets RESULTS Through MR analysis we successfully identified five plasma proteins that are causally linked to JIA Genetically inferred lower levels of AIF1 TNF and TNFSF11 were associated with an elevated risk of JIA while higher levels of AGER and GP1BA proteins were positively correlated with JIA risk Colocalization analysis further supported our findings on GP1BA OR  926 95  CI 2303720 and TNFSF11 OR  018 95  CI 007045 Based on this evidence we classified these five proteins into two tiers Finally we conducted a systematic evaluation of the druggability and

to understanding protein function and is essential for progress in bioengineering drug discovery and molecular biology Recently with the incorporation of generative AI the power and accuracy of computational protein structure predictiondesign have been improved significantly However ethical concerns such as copyright protection and harmful content generation biosecurity pose challenges to the wide implementation of protein generative models Here we investigate whether it is possible to embed watermarks into protein generative models and their outputs for copyright authentication and the tracking of generated structures As a proof of concept we propose a twostage method FoldMark as a generalized watermarking strategy for protein generative models FoldMark first pretrain watermark encoder and decoder which can minorly adjust protein structures to embed userspecific information and faithfully recover the information from the encoded structure In the second step protein generative models are finetuned with watermark LowRank Adaptation LoRA modules to preserve generation quality while learning to generate watermarked structures with high recovery rates Extensive experiments are conducted on opensource protein structure prediction models eg ESMFold and MultiFlow and de novo structure design models eg FrameDiff and FoldFlow and we demonstrate that our method is

Adelaide Medical School University of Adelaide Adelaide SA Australia For over seven decades dopamine receptor 2 D2 receptor antagonists remained the mainstay treatment for neuropsychiatric disorders Although it is effective for treating hyperdopaminergic symptoms it is often ineffective for treating negative and cognitive deficits Trace amineassociated receptor 1 TAAR1 is a novel pharmacological target in the treatment of schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric conditions Several TAAR1 agonists are currently being developed and are in various stages of clinical and preclinical development Previous efforts to identify TAAR1 agonists have been hampered by challenges in pharmacological characterisation the absence of experimentally determined structures and speciesspecific preferences in ligand binding and recognition Further poor insights into the functional selectivity of the receptor led to the characterisation of ligands with analogous signalling mechanisms Such approaches limited the understanding of divergent receptor signalling and their potential clinical utility Recent cryogenic electron microscopic cryoEM structures of human and mouse TAAR1 hTAAR1 and mTAAR1 respectively in complex with agonists and G proteins have revealed detailed atomic insights into the binding pockets binding interactions and binding modes of several agonists including endogenous trace amines \u03b2phenylethylamine 3Iodothyronamine psychostimulants amphetamine methamphetamine clinical compounds ulotaront ralmitaront and repurposed drugs fenoldopam The in vitro screening of drug libraries has also led to the discovery of novel TAAR1 agonists asenapine guanabenz guanfacine which can be used in clinical trials or further developed to treat different neuropsychiatric conditions Furthermore an understanding of unappreciated signalling mechanisms Gq GsGq by TAAR1 agonists has come to light with the discovery of selective compounds to treat schizophrenialike phenotypes In this

Program Department of Science and Technology Industrial Technology Development Institute Taguig Philippines 2ST Fellows Program Department of Science and Technology Bicutan Taguig Philippines 3Department of Biology College of Arts and Sciences University of the Philippines Manila Manila Philippines BACKGROUND Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus PEDV is a recurring coronavirus that causes severe diarrhea in pigs with high mortality and morbidity rates especially in neonatal pigs Despite the availability of vaccines their efficacy is limited owing to antigenic differences between the vaccine and field strains which poses a challenge to infection control Antiviral drugs targeting conserved PEDV proteins show promise for complementing vaccination strategies PEDV Nsp3 PL2Pro and Nsp5 3CLPro are essential proteases vital for viral replication making them attractive targets for drug development against PEDV AIM To address the lack of therapeutics against recurring PEDV outbreaks and bridge the gap in the application of bioinformatics in veterinary drug discovery this study aimed to discover compounds that inhibit PEDV proteases from Philippine medicinal plants by applying a modified virtual screening methodology that considers the physiology of swine hosts METHODS This study employed a library of 690 metabolites from Philippine medicinal plants to screen for potential protease inhibitors targeting PEDV PL2Pro and 3CLPro This includes evaluating the binding affinity pharmacokinetics dynamic stability and critical binding site residues Compounds demonstrating high affinity underwent a modified ADMET analysis considering the enteric localization of the virus and potential toxicity to swine hosts Furthermore molecular dynamics simulations assessed compound stability under physiological swine conditions RESULTS The study identified Bisandrographolide from Andrographis paniculata CID 162866964 from Euphorbia neriifolia and betulinic acid from Vitex negundo and Ocimum basilicum as metabolites that bind favorably and selectively to PEDV 3CLPro and have excellent pharmacokinetic properties and dynamic stability In contrast no selective inhibitor for PL2pro passed the same criteria CONCLUSION Employing the modified virtual screening protocol tailored for swine host considerations the compounds identified in this study are anticipated to exert inhibitory effects against PEDV without offtarget binding to analogous swine proteases and receptors CID 162866964 bisandrographolide and betulinic acid show promise for developing potent antivirals

or other mechanisms results in derepression of let7 target genes some of which are oncogenic eg MYCN potentially contributing to tumor progression and drug resistance We have developed a cellbased assay to identify small molecules that increase levels of mature functional let7 miRNAs by inhibiting the function of Lin28B protein or by other means This system consists of a reporter gene GFP regulated by the tTRKRAB repressor protein which in turn is regulated by processed let7 miRNAs Using this system we screened approximately 4000 small molecules and identified more than a dozen compounds capable of augmenting levels of mature let7 miRNAs Among those compounds Kenpaullone and BIO were shown to increase let7 miRNA levels with consequent suppression of MYCN protein in neuroblastoma cell lines This novel strategy provides an additional cellbased assay for candidate cancer drug screening in a high throughput setting and will facilitate the identification of anticancer drugs Moreover this assay could be used to screen shRNA and CRISPR libraries to identify novel components of the LIN28let7 axis which may provide new therapeutic targets AJCR Copyright

US Food and Drug Administration FDAapproved treatments for amphetaminetype stimulant use disorders ATSUD The aim of this study was to utilize a drug discovery framework that integrates artificial intelligence AIbased drug prediction clinical corroboration and mechanism of action analysis to identify FDAapproved drugs that can be repurposed for treating ATSUD DESIGN AND SETTING An AIbased knowledge graph model was first utilized to prioritize FDAapproved drugs in their potential efficacy for treating ATSUD Among the top 10 ranked candidate drugs ketamine represented a novel candidate with few studies examining its effects on ATSUD We therefore conducted a retrospective cohort study to assess the association between ketamine and ATSUD remission using US electronic health record EHR data Finally we analyzed the potential mechanisms of action of ketamine in the context of ATSUD PARTICIPANTS AND MEASUREMENTS ATSUD patients who received anesthesia n  3663 or were diagnosed with depression n  4328 between January 2019 and June 2022 The outcome measure was the diagnosis of ATSUD remission within one year of the drug prescription FINDINGS Ketamine for anesthesia in ATSUD patients was associated with greater ATSUD remission compared with other anesthetics hazard ratio HR  158 95 confidence interval CI  115217 Similar results were found for ATSUD patients with

particularly in the context of metastatic disease Surgical removal of primary tumors while essential can inadvertently heighten the risk of metastasis Thus there is a critical need for innovative neoadjuvant therapies capable of curtailing metastatic progression before or immediately following tumor resection Addressing this imperative the papaya mosaic virus nanoparticle PapMV has demonstrated potent immunostimulatory capabilities against both viruses and tumors effectively hindering their proliferation Our study reveals that PapMV exerts a protective effect against lung metastasis when administered systemically prior to tumor implantation or during the early stages of metastasis in various mouse models of cancer This antitumor effect is initiated by the recruitment of myeloid cells in the lungs These cells adopt a proinflammatory profile secreting cytokines such as IFN\u03b1 thus fostering a tumor microenvironment inhospitable to tumor progression Crucially this protective mechanism hinges on the presence of macrophages before treatment TLR7 and IFNI signaling pathways also play pivotal roles in this process Furthermore our findings demonstrate that PapMV triggers the activation of the bone marrow emergency response which accounts for the influx of myeloid cells into the lungs This study unveils a novel aspect of PapMVs functionality By bolstering the immune system PapMV confers robust protection against metastasis at an early stage of disease progression This discovery holds promise for therapeutic intervention particularly as a preemptive measure

available to tackle this deadly infection Thus identifying novel potent scaffolds using innovative strategies is the need of the hour Highthroughput screening HTS is a critical technique that can accelerate the process of drug discovery by evaluating millions of druglike molecules using various automation tools and biological assays In the present study we have employed the HTS strategy to identify potent hits against Leishmania donovani sterol C24 methyltransferase LdSMT from the inhouse ChemBridge library Firstly a robust dataset was prepared with previously reported sterol C24 methyltransferase inhibitors belonging to diverse structural classes Then ligandbased virtual screening using similarity search was performed to screen the ChemBridge library having 20000 molecules This computational approach yielded 81 candidate compounds which were selected for further molecular docking and biological evaluation Antileishmanial assays revealed that out of 81 molecules seven showed potential parasitic killing Three molecules namely IIIMCB14 IIIMCB29 and IIIMCB45 were the most potent ones with 50 inhibitory concentration IC50 of 576 808 and 1064 \u00b5gmL respectively SEM analyses suggest that these potent hits cause considerable morphological alterations ADME studies of the potent hit molecules indicate that all the hits have considerable druglikeness properties Further molecular dynamics studies were also performed to check the stable confirmation of LdSMT protein with the top two hits IIIMCB14 and IIIMCB45 Thus the present study harnesses computational and

cyclosporine since its inception into the clinics in the 70s and up have played a crucial role in the advancement of transplant therapy and containment of immunebased rejections The drug had improved rates of acute rejections and supported early graft survival However the longterm survival of renal allografts is still less prevalent and an indepth analysis and reported findings led us to believe that there is a chronic irreversible component to the drug that is tackled through its metabolites and causes toxicity which led to new therapies including monoclonal antibody based medications A recap of the immunosuppressive effects and entwined toxicity of the drug now relegated to solid transplants overviews the past protocols used to minimize and avoid or use in combination with this calcineurin inhibitor class drug with other drugs The current review circumvents the cyclosporines mechanism of action pathophysiology cytochrome roles and other factors associated with acute and chronic toxicity It also attempts to find conclusive strategies reported in recent studies to avoid its toxic side effects and develop a safeuse strategy for the drug Gastrointestinal decontamination supporting the airway monitoring for signs of respiratory insufficiency monitoring for severe reactions such as seizures administration of oxygen and avoiding the administration of drugs that increase the blood levels of cyclosporine are beneficial interventions when encountering cyclosporine toxicity cases The constrained therapeutic outcome has also led to redesign and combine formulation to

is crucial for biomedical research and drug development to address the ethical and biological limitations of animal testing Recently 3D skin models have proven to be effective for studying serious skin conditions such as melanoma For these advanced models to be applicable in preclinical studies thorough characterization is essential to understand their applicability and limitations In this study we used bioimaging and RNA sequencing to assess the architecture and transcriptomic profiles of skin models including models with melanoma Our results indicated that these models closely mimicked skin morphology and gene expression patterns The fullthickness FT model shows a superior resemblance to the human skin particularly in basement membrane formation and cellular interactions The integrity of the skinlike properties and gene expression signatures of both skin and melanoma cells were preserved upon the integration of melanoma cells establishing these models as robust platforms for cancer research The responsiveness of the FT melanoma models to vemurafenib treatment was successfully monitored demonstrating their validity as a reliable reproducible and humane tool for pharmacological testing and drug development Furthermore the transcriptomic data showed that skin models with cancer spheroids had upregulated genes linked to aggressive and resilient cancer behavior compared to spheroids alone This emphasizes the importance of the microenvironment in cancer progression and suggests that 3D skin models can serve to uncover mechanisms and therapeutic targets that are not detectable in simpler systems STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE This study introduces advanced ethically sound skin and melanoma models as alternatives to animal testing in drug discovery By thoroughly characterizing these models using bioimaging and RNA sequencing we demonstrate their close resemblance to human skin particularly in fullthickness models These models not only replicate the complex cellular interactions and gene expression patterns of human tissue but also maintain robustness after melanoma integration Our findings highlight the potential of these models in revealing cancer mechanisms and therapeutic targets offering a significant impact on melanoma research and preclinical testing Copyright  2024 Published by Elsevier Ltd DOI 101016jactbio202411018 PMID 39549863

impact the global shrimp farming industry with a mortality rate of 70 100  The key virulence factors are a pair of Photorhabdus insectrelated Pirlike toxins PirAvp and PirBvp In this study by using an in vitro transcription and translation assay we first confirmed that the quorum sensing transcriptional regulator AphBvp could trigger the expression of its downstream genes after binding to the AphBvp binding sequence in the promoter region of the pirAvppirBvp operon Next we showed that AphBvp was essential for the expression of these toxins by using an aphBvpdeletion mutant \u0394aphBvp derived from the AHPNDcausing Vibrio parahaemolyticus Lastly we discovered that the expression levels of PirAvp and PirBvp were upregulated under acidic conditions pH 45 and further showed that an acidic environment promoted the binding of AphBvp to the pirABvp promoter We speculate that this was because the acidic environment favored the formation of AphBvp tetramers which is important for binding to DNA Taken together these findings improve our understanding of the gene regulatory mechanisms of pirAvp and pirBvp and suggest that the pH value of the environment might affect the

Molecular and Clinical Medicine Institute of Medicine Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg Gothenburg Sweden BACKGROUND SGLT2 inhibitors a T2DM medication to lower blood glucose markedly improve cardiovascular outcomes but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood SGLT2is produce a unique metabolic pattern by lowering blood glucose without increasing insulin while increasing ketone body and glucagon levels and reducing body weight We tested if glucagon signaling contributes to SGLT2i induced improvement in CV function METHODS Cardiac contractility and coronary flow velocity reserve CFVR were monitored in obob mice and rhesus monkeys with metabolic syndrome using echocardiography Metabolic status was characterized by measuring blood ketone levels glucose tolerance during glucose challenge and Arg and ADMA levels were measured Baysian models were developed to analyse the data RESULTS Dapagliflozin improved CFVR and contractility coapplication of a glucagon receptor inhibitor GcgRi blunted the effect on CFVR but not contractility Dapagliflozin increased the ArgADMA ratio and ketone levels and cotreatment with GcgRi blunted only the Dapagliflozin induced increase in ArgADMA ratio but not ketone levels CONCLUSIONS Since GcgRi cotreatment only reduced the ArgADMA increase we hypothesize that dapagliflozin via a glucagonsignaling dependent pathway improves vascular function through the NOsignaling pathway leading to improved vascular function Increase in ketone levels might be a contributing factor in SGLT2i induced contractility increase and does not require glucagon signaling  2024 The Authors DOI 101186s1293302402491w PMCID PMC11568596 PMID 39548491 Indexed for MEDLINE Conflict of interest statement Declarations Ethics

positive High CA199 levels correlate with increased aggressiveness and worse outcomes This study employs multiomics analysis to reveal molecular features and identify therapeutic targets of CA199 positive ICC aiming to support individualized treatment METHODS Data from seven clinical cohorts two wholeexome sequencing cohorts six RNA sequencingmicroarray cohorts one proteomic cohort 20 singlecell RNA sequencing samples and one spatial transcriptome sample were analyzed Key findings were validated on tissue microarrays from 52 ICC samples RESULTS CA199 positive ICC exhibited poorer OS median 241 vs 515 months and RFS median 117 vs 282 months compared to negative group all P  005 Genomic analysis revealed a higher KRAS mutation frequency in the positive group and a greater prevalence of IDH12 mutations in the negative group all P  005 Transcriptomic analysis indicated upregulated glycolysis pathways in CA199 positive ICC Singlecell analysis identified specific glycolysisrelated cell subclusters associated with poor prognosis including Epi_SLC2A1 CAF_VEGFA and Mph_SPP1 Higher hypoxia in the CA199 positive group led to metabolic reprogramming and promoted these cells formation These cells formed interactive communities promoting epithelialmesenchymal transition EMT and angiogenesis Drug sensitivity analysis identified six potential therapeutic drugs

allowed bacteria to adapt and develop coping mechanisms ultimately leading to the concerning escalation of multidrug resistance Bacterial persisters are a subpopulation that can survive briefly under high concentrations of antibiotic treatment and resume growth after lethal stress Importantly bacterial persisters are thought to be a significant cause of ineffective antibiotic therapy and recurrent infections in clinical practice and are thought to contribute to the development of antibiotic resistance Therefore it is essential to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of persister formation and to develop precise medical strategies to combat persistent infections However there are many difficulties in studying persisters due to their small proportion in the microbiota and their nonheritable nature In this review we discuss the similarities and differences of antibiotic resistance tolerance persistence and viable but nonculturable cells summarize the molecular mechanisms that affect the formation of persisters and outline the emerging technologies in the study of persisters  2024 The Authors DOI 101186s12866024036283 PMCID PMC11568608 PMID 39548389 Indexed for MEDLINE Conflict of

cancer thereby driving tumour development and drug resistance Here we used singlecell RNA sequencing to study APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B expression in healthy and malignant mucosal epithelia validating key observations with immunohistochemistry spatial transcriptomics and functional experiments Whereas APOBEC3B is expressed in keratinocytes entering mitosis we show that APOBEC3A expression is confined largely to terminally differentiating cells and requires grainyheadlike transcription factor 3 GRHL3 Thus in normal tissue neither deaminase appears to be expressed at high levels during DNA replication the cellcycle stage associated with APOBECmediated mutagenesis In contrast in squamous cell carcinoma we find that there is expansion of GRHL3expression and activity to a subset of cells undergoing DNA replication and concomitant extension of APOBEC3A expression to proliferating cells These findings suggest that APOBEC3A may play a functional role during keratinocyte differentiation and offer a mechanism for acquisition of APOBEC3A mutagenic activity in tumours  2024 The Authors DOI 101038s44318024002989 PMID 39548236 Conflict of interest statement Disclosure and competing

analysis Five candidate molecules were finally obtained after visual analysis and MMPBSA calculations We subsequently assessed their competitive displacement efficiency through a microdialysis experiment and the results revealed that ZINC000008791789 ZINC000012297018 and ZINC000012296493 are promising binding competitors for PBUTs as they have higher dialysis efficiency than the optimal displacer LA approximately double the dialysis efficiency The other two molecules ZINC000031161007 and ZINC000004090361 although less efficient than LA still outperformed the control group Notably

severely reduced activity against gametocytes The impact of this activity loss on a compounds transmissionblocking activity is unclear Here we report the systematic evaluation of the activity loss against gametocytes and investigate the confounding factors contributing to this A threshold for acceptable activity loss between asexual blood stage parasites and gametocytes was defined with nearequipotent compounds required to prevent continued gametocyte maturation and onward transmission Target abundance is not predictive of gametocytocidal activity but instead lipoidal uptake is the main barrier of dual activity and is influenced by distinct physicochemical properties This study provides guidelines for the required profiles of potential dualactive antimalarial agents and

drug efficacy Although trifluoromethyl heteroaromatic amines and derivatives are prevalent frameworks in pharmaceuticals the development of trifluoromethylembedded intricately structured alkyl amine scaffolds for medicinal research remains a significant challenge Herein we present a metallaphotoredox multicomponent amination strategy employing 333trifluoropropene nitroarenes tertiary alkylamines and carboxylic acids This synthetic pathway offers notable advantages including the accessibility and costeffectiveness of starting materials high levels of chemo and regioselectivity and modularity Furthermore this approach enables the synthesis of a broad spectrum of aniline compounds featuring both trifluoromethyl group and distal quaternary carbon motifs along the aliphatic chains The

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Oral delivery of peptide therapeutics is limited by degradation by gut proteases like chymotrypsin Existing databases of peptidases are limited in size and do not enable systematic analyses of protease substrate preferences especially for nonnatural amino acids Thus stability optimization of hit compounds is time and resource intensive To accelerate the stability optimization of peptide ligands we generated large datasets of chymotrypsinresistant peptides via mRNA display to create a predictive model for chymotrypsinresistant sequences Through analysis of enriched motifs we recapitulate known chymotrypsin cleavage sites reveal positionally dependent effects of monomers on peptide cleavage and report previously unidentified protective and destabilizing residues We then developed a machinelearningbased model predicting peptide resistance to chymotrypsin cleavage and validated both model performance and the NGS experimental data by measuring chymotrypsin halflives for a subset of peptides Finally we simulated stability predictions on nonnatural amino acids through a leucine holdout model and observed robust performance Overall we demonstrate the utility of mRNA display as a tool for big data generation and show that pairing mRNA display with machine learning yields valuable predictions for chymotrypsin cleavage Expansion of this workflow to additional proteases could provide complementary predictive models that focus future peptide drug discovery efforts  2024 WileyVCH GmbH DOI 101002cbic202400760 PMID 39547944", "1

this decade and unlike most cancers there has been little progress in improving survival in PDAC Numerous studies including molecular and mechanistic studies cancer biology studies and retrospective human epidemiological studies suggest that two wellknown approved drug classes  \u03b2blockers and H1antihistamines  may be beneficial and thus may potentially prolong life in patients with PDAC In our opinion the body of evidence has reached a point where the potential gains outweigh the very low risks involved in a clinical study in PDAC We thus believe that it is now time for a clinical trial involving these two agents in PDAC patients As a repurposing of generic drugs this is not likely to be appealing to pharmaceutical companies and therefore is likely to require governmental philanthropic and or charitable organisational input In this article we opine and propose that an urgent clinical trial is needed to determine if repurposing these two orally administered inexpensive largely safe drug classes either alone or in combination could prolong survival in PDAC and thus improve the outcome for the 10000 people worldwide who die from PDAC each week  The Authors 2024

Mitochondrial diseases often caused by defects in complex I CI of the oxidative phosphorylation system currently lack curative treatments Humanrelevant highthroughput drug screening platforms are crucial for the discovery of effective therapeutics with induced pluripotent stem cells iPSCs emerging as a valuable technology for this purpose Here we present a novel iPSC model of NDUFS4related CI deficiency that displays a strong metabolic phenotype in the pluripotent state Human iPSCs were edited using CRISPRCas9 to target the NDUFS4 gene generating isogenic NDUFS4 knockout KO cell lines Sanger sequencing detected heterozygous biallelic deletions whereas no indel mutations were found in isogenic control cells Western blotting confirmed the absence of NDUFS4 protein in KO iPSCs and CI enzyme kinetics showed a 56  reduction in activity compared to isogenic controls Comprehensive metabolomic profiling revealed a distinct metabolic phenotype in NDUFS4 KO iPSCs predominantly associated with an elevated NADHNAD ratio consistent with alterations observed in other models of mitochondrial dysfunction Additionally \u03b2lapachone a recognized NAD modulator alleviated reductive stress in KO iPSCs by modifying the redox state in both the cytosol and mitochondria Although undifferentiated iPSCs cannot fully replicate the complex cellular dynamics of the disease seen in vivo these findings highlight the utility of iPSCs in providing a relevant metabolic milieu that can facilitate earlystage highthroughput exploration of therapeutic strategies for mitochondrial dysfunction

boronic acid analog of combretastatin A4 CA4 a series of analogs featuring a boronic acid group on the C phenyl ring of CA4 was synthesized and evaluated for cytotoxicity as well as for their ability to inhibit tubulin polymerization inhibit the binding of 3Hcolchicine to tubulin and cause depolymerization of cellular microtubules Modifications on the C ring of CA4 either eliminating the methoxy group or replacing the C phenyl ring with a pyridine ring resulted in a reduced potency for inhibiting tubulin polymerization colchicine binding and cytotoxic activities as compared to CA4 Replacing the phenol group with a boronic acid group on the C ring of phenstatin led to a slight increase in cytotoxic potency but a decreased potency for inhibition of tubulin assembly and colchicine binding Moreover there was a significant decrease in activity by replacing the C phenyl ring with a pyridine ring Our results indicate the critical importance of the methoxy group on the C ring as well as the importance of the C phenyl ring compared to a pyridine ring despite the latter providing a nitrogen atom as a hydrogen bond donoracceptor which was predicted by molecular modeling to enhance interaction with the target The decreased activities of our modified CA4 boronic analogs may be attributed to weakened hydrogen bonding in our docking model based on the crystal structure of colchicine bound to \u03b1\u03b2tubulin Notably even though their effectiveness in inhibiting tubulin polymerization and colchicine binding and causing microtubule depolymerization in cells the majority of these boronic acid analogs exhibited substantial cytotoxicity This suggests that they may have additional cellular targets that contribute to their cytotoxicity and this warrants further

the great number of experimental investigations in the area of psychoneuroendocrineimmunology showing that endocrine nervous and immune systems cannot be in vivo physiologically separated the diagnosis and therapies of the pathologies of these three functional biological systems continue to be separately performed from a clinical practice point of view The separation between experimental and clinical medicine became dramatic after the discovery of more than 10 human molecules provided by antiinflammatory and antitumor activity completely devoid of any toxicity which may be subdivided into three fundamental classes consisting of the pineal indole betacarboline and methoxykynuramine hormones Moreover human systemic diseases including cancer autoimmunity and cardiovascular pathologies despite their different pathogenesis and symptomatology are commonly characterized by a progressive decline in the endogenous production of pineal hormones endocannabinoids and Ang 17 with a consequent inflammatory status and diminished natural resistance against cancer Then the evaluation of the functional status of the pineal gland the endocannabinoid system and ACE2Ang 17 axis should have to be included within the laboratory analyses for the systemic diseases Finally the correction of cancer and autoimmunityrelated neuroimmune and neuroendocrine alterations could influence the clinical course of systemic diseases In fact preliminary clinical results would demonstrate that the neuroimmune regimen with pineal hormones cannabinoids and Ang 17 may allow clinical benefits also in patients affected by systemic pathologies including cancer autoimmunity and cardiovascular diseases who did not respond to the standard therapies  2025 The Authors under exclusive license to

ASA is a clinical drug with multiple effects including prevention of cardiovascular adverse events and anticancer effects However gastrointestinal side effects such as gastrointestinal ulcers and bleeding limit the use of ASA and reduce patient compliance Various studies have investigated the mechanisms of ASAinduced gastrointestinal injury and many medicines have been reported to be effective in preventing and treating the adverse gastrointestinal effects of ASA New formulations of ASA have demonstrated milder gastrointestinal injury than ASA alone In this article we summarized the mechanisms of ASAinduced gastrointestinal injury drugs that resist gastrointestinal side effects of ASA and progress in research on formulation improvement of ASA to help resolve the clinical dilemma

repositioning of carvedilol an antihypertensive drug incorporated into MCM41 mesoporous silica The repositioning proposes a reduction in the slow pace of discovery of new drugs as well as toxicological safety and a significant reduction in high research costs making it an attractive strategy for researchers and large pharmaceutical companies We obtained MCM41 bytemplatesynthesis and functionalized it by postsynthesis grafting with aminopropyltriethoxysilane APTES only or with folic acid FA which gave MCM41APTES and MCM41APTESFA respectively We characterized the materials by scanning and transmission electron microscopy zeta potential ZP measurements Fourier transform infrared absorption spectroscopy xray diffractometry nitrogen gas adsorption and CHNS elemental analysis We quantified the percentage of drug that was incorporated into the MCM41 materials by thermogravimetric analysis and evaluated their cytotoxic activity in nontumor human lung fibroblasts and the tumor human melanoma and human cervical adenocarcinoma cell lines by XTT salt reduction 23bis2methoxy4nitro5sulfophenyl2Htetrazolium5arboxanilide The xray diffractograms of the MCM41 materials displayed lowangle peaks in the 2\u03b8range between 2 and 3 and the materials presented type IV nitrogen adsorption isotherms and H2 hysteresis typical of the MCM41hexagonal network The infrared spectra the charge changes revealed by ZP measurements and the CHN ratios obtained from elemental analysis showed that MCM41 was aminofunctionalized and that carvedilol was incorporated into it MCM41APTES incorporated 2380 carvedilol whereas MCM41 and MCM41APTESFA incorporated 1869 and 1271 carvedilol respectively Incorporated carvedilol was less cytotoxic to tumor and nontumor cells than the pure drug Carvedilol repositioning proved favorable and encourages further studies aimed at reducing its cytotoxicity to nontumor cells Such studies may allow for larger carvedilol incorporation into drug carriers or motivate the search for a new drug nanocarrier to optimize the carvedilol antitumoral activity  2024 IOP Publishing Ltd All rights including for text and data mining AI training

opportunistic yeast pathogen with a high rate of fluconazole resistance FLZR echinocandin resistance ECR and multidrug resistance MDR relative to other Candida However the fitness of C glabrata MDR isolates particularly in the host is poorly characterized and studies of FLZR isolate fitness have produced contradictory findings Two important host niches for C glabrata are macrophages in which it survives and proliferates and the gut Herein we used a collection of clinical and labderived C glabrata isolates to show that FLZR C glabrata isolates are less fit inside macrophages than susceptible isolates and that this fitness cost is reversed by acquiring ECR mutations Interestingly dualRNAseq revealed that macrophages infected with drugresistant isolates mount an inflammatory response whereas intracellular drugresistant cells downregulate processes required for inhost adaptation Furthermore drugresistant isolates were outcompeted by their susceptible counterparts during gut colonization and in infected kidneys while showing comparable fitness in the spleen Collectively our study shows that macrophagerich organs such as the spleen favor the retention of MDR isolates of C

and developmental biology I was conducting basic biological research into cell differentiation and migration using D discoideum and during this process our research group made a discovery with potential implications for drug development Specifically we found that a chlorinated polyketide named differentiationinducing factor 1 DIF1 derived from D discoideum exhibits antitumor activity Based on this discovery I began elucidating the mechanism of the antitumor action of DIF1 and developing anticancer drugs using DIF1 as a lead compound During this period in 1991 I obtained my PhD in research related to D discoideum cell differentiation and subsequently served as a Japan Society for the Promotion of Science JSPS Special Research Fellow before joining the Institute for Molecular and Cellular Regulation IMCR at Gunma University in 1993 I then joined the Graduate School of Health and Sports Sciences at Juntendo University in 2015 where I have been until 2024 Throughout this period I continued my research on DIF1 and discovered that DIF1 and its derivatives possess various biological activities  such as antidiabetic immunoregulatory antibacterial and antimalarial

efficacy as an intratumoral immunotherapy providing a strong argument for its clinical translation One important consideration for any new drug candidate is the longterm stability of the drug and its formulation Therefore our lab has evaluated the physical stability and biological activity that is antitumor potency of formulations of CPMV in buffer with and without a sucrose preservative in multiple temperature conditions ranging from ultralow freezers to a heated incubator over a period of 9 months We found that nonrefrigerated temperatures 37C and room temperature quickly led to CPMV destabilization as evidenced by significant protein and RNA degradation after just 1 week Refrigerated storage at 4C extended physical stability though signs of particle breakage and RNA escape appeared after 6 and 9 months CPMV stored in frozen conditions including 20C 80C and liquid N2 remained intact and matched the characteristics of fresh CPMV throughout the duration of the study The biological activity was evaluated using a murine dermal melanoma model and efficacy followed the observed trends in physical stability CPMV stored in refrigerated and warmer conditions exhibited decreased antitumor efficacy compared to freshly prepared formulations Meanwhile frozenstored CPMV performed similarly to freshly purified CPMV resulting in reduced tumor growth and extended survival Data therefore indicates that CPMV stored longterm in cold or frozen conditions remains stable and efficacious providing additional support to advance this powerful plant virus to translation  2024

risk factor for orthopedic disorders particularly intervertebral disc IVD degenerative disease However the IVD pathophysiology especially the spatialtemporal remodeling progression in the context of cigarette smoking remains unclear This study aimed to address this knowledge gap through a quantitative assessment of IVD structural composition and diffusion properties using a SpragueDawley rat model METHODS Twentyfour rats were divided into control and smoke exposure cohorts each with two subgroups of six rats One smoke exposure subgroup was sacrificed after 2 months of daily cigarette smoke exposure in a custom smoking apparatus while the other was sacrificed after an additional 5 months of smoke cessation The control groups were agematched to the smoke exposure groups A fluorescent recovery after photobleaching FRAP technique was used to determine solute diffusivities and multiphoton excitation MPE imaging was performed to characterize structural changes in the annulus fibrosus AF nucleus pulposus NP and cartilage endplate CEP RESULTS A decrease in diffusivity was observed in the CEP and the AF radial direction only after 2 months of smoke exposure MPE imaging showed aberrant CEP calcification and reduced AF radial collagen fiber bundle diameter suggesting that the IVD exhibits regionally dependent structural remodeling due to smoke exposure Furthermore the smoke cessation group showed deteriorating alterations of structure and diffusivities in all threedisc regions including the NP indicating that fivemonth smoke cessation alone didnt reverse the progression of IVD degenerative remodeling during aging CONCLUSION This study advances the understanding of IVD pathophysiology in the context of cigarette smoke exposure and cessation

infection How different bacterial pathogens harness DXPS activity to adapt and survive within host environments remains incompletely understood and tools for probing DXPS function in different

subsequently crosslinks to the DXPS active site upon photoactivation ABP 1 displays low micromolar potency against DXPS and dosedependent labeling of DXPS that is blocked by alkylAPbased inhibitors The probe displays selectivity for DXPS over ThDPdependent enzymes and is capable of detecting active DXPS in a complex proteome These studies represent an important advance toward development of

The Chinese University of Hong Kong Shenzhen 518172 China 2Shenzhen Bay Laboratory Shenzhen 518172 China Protein disulfide isomerase PDI was recently shown to be an upstream mediator of erastininduced glutathione depletionassociated ferroptosis through its catalysis of nitric oxide synthase NOS dimerization and nitric oxide NO accumulation A recent study reported that RSL3 a known ferroptosis inducer and glutathione peroxidase 4 GPX4 inhibitor can inhibit thioredoxin reductase 1 TrxR1 The present study seeks to test the hypothesis that RSL3 may through its inhibition of TrxR1 facilitate PDI activation  i e in a catalytically active oxidized state thereby enhancing RSL3induced ferroptosis through NOS dimerization and NO accumulation Using HT22 mouse neuronal cells as an in vitro model we show that treatment of these cells with RSL3 strongly increases NOS protein levels and that PDImediated NOS dimerization is activated by RSL3 resulting in NO accumulation Mechanistically we find that PDI is activated in cells treated with RSL3 because of its inhibition of TrxR1 and the activated PDI then catalyzes NOS dimerization which is followed by the accumulation of cellular NO ROS and lipidROS and ultimately ferroptotic cell death Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of PDI or TrxR1 partially abrogates RSL3induced NOS activation and the subsequent accumulation of cellular NO ROSlipidROS and ultimately ferroptosis in HT22 cells The results of this study clearly show that PDI activation resulted from RSL3 inhibition of TrxR1 activity contributes crucially to RSL3induced

194 million in 2003 to 333 million in 2025 with type 2 diabetes mellitus representing approximately 9095 of cases Dual inhibitors for antidiabetic targets is still novel and promising strategy for discovery of more effective therapies Ester and triazole derivatives of pcoumaric acid were obtained from Williamson synthesis and Microwaveassisted click reaction respectively Chemical structures were finely characterized through IR 1H and 13C NMR and HRMS They were tested for their dual inhibitory activity against GSK3\u03b2 kinase and DPPIV The complexes resulting from docking were used for allatom molecular dynamics simulations including the enzymes in the apo form using the GROMACS 20223 Two inhibitors 2 and 5 demonstrated promising inhibition at low and submicromolar against both proteins Molecular Dynamic simulations revealed that the binding pattern of the control inhibitors were reproduced by pcoumaric acid derivatives 2 and 5 with crucial interactions involving the same residues The pcoumaric skeleton can be considered as a promising core for GSK3\u03b2 kinase and DPPIV dual inhibitors  2024 John Wiley  Sons Ltd DOI 101111cbdd70016 PMID 39543966 Indexed for MEDLINE",

devise treatments to combat SARSCoV2 A limited array of smallmolecule antiviral drugs specifically monoclonal antibodies and interferon therapy have been sanctioned to treat COVID19 These treatments typically necessitate administration within ten days of symptom onset There have been reported reductions in the effectiveness of these medications due to mutations in nonstructural protein genes particularly against Omicron subvariants This underscores the pressing requirement for healthcare systems to continually monitor pathogen variability and its impact on the efficacy of prevention and treatments AIM This review aimed to comprehend the therapeutic benefits and recent progress of nMAbs for preventing and treating the Omicron variant of SARSCoV2 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies nMAbs provide a treatment avenue for severely affected individuals especially those at high risk for whom vaccination is not viable With their specific epitope affinity they pose no significant risk of severe adverse effects The degree of reduction in neutralization varies significantly across different monoclonal antibodies and variant combinations For instance Sotrovimab maintained its neutralization effectiveness against Omicron BA1 but exhibited diminished efficacy against BA2 BA4 BA5 and BA2121 CONCLUSION Bebtelovimab has been observed to preserve its efficacy against all subtypes of the Omicron variant Subsequently WKS13 mAb39 19n01 F61d2 cocktail etc have become effective This review has highlighted the therapeutic implications of nMAbs in SARSCoV2

Indianapolis IN 46202 USA meyerjasiuedu Glaucoma is a neurodegenerative disease that results in the degeneration of retinal ganglion cells RGCs and subsequent loss of vision While RGCs are the primary cell type affected in glaucoma neighboring cell types selectively modulate RGCs to maintain overall homeostasis Among these neighboring cell types astrocytes microvascular endothelial cells MVECs and pericytes coordinate with neurons to form the neurovascular unit that provides a physical barrier to limit the passage of toxic materials from the blood into neural tissue Previous studies have demonstrated that these barrier properties may be compromised in the progression of glaucoma yet mechanisms by which this happens have remained incompletely understood Thus the goals of this study were to adapt a human pluripotent stem cell hPSCbased model of the neurovascular unit to the study of barrier integrity relevant to glaucoma To achieve this hPSCs were differentiated into the cell types that contribute to this barrier including RGCs astrocytes and MVECs then assembled into an established Transwellinsert model The ability of these cell types to contribute to an in vitro barrier model was tested for their ability to recapitulate characteristic barrier properties Results revealed that barrier properties of MVECs were enhanced when cultured in the presence of RGCs and astrocytes compared to MVECs cultured alone Conversely the versatility of this system to model aspects of barrier dysfunction relevant to glaucoma was tested using an hPSC line with a glaucomaspecific Optineurin E50K mutation as well as a paired isogenic control where MVECs then exhibited reduced barrier integrity To identify factors that could result in barrier dysfunction results revealed an increased expression of TGF\u03b22 in glaucomaassociated OPTNE50K astrocytes indicating a potential role for TGF\u03b22 in disease manifestation To test this hypothesis we explored the ability to modulate exogenous TGF\u03b22 in both isogenic control and OPTNE50K experimental conditions Collectively the results of this study indicated that the repurposing of this in vitro barrier model for glaucoma reliably mimicked some aspects of barrier dysfunction and may serve as a platform for drug discovery as well as a powerful in vitro model to test the consequences of barrier dysfunction upon RGCs in glaucoma  2024 The Authors DOI 101186s1298702400593x PMCID PMC11566410 PMID 39543684 Indexed for MEDLINE Conflict of interest statement Declarations Ethics approval and consent to participate

structureproperty relationship QSPR models is a challenging task First the experimental data needs to be obtained analyzed and curated Second the number of available methods is continuously growing and evaluating different algorithms and methodologies can be arduous Finally the last hurdle that researchers face is to ensure the reproducibility of their models and facilitate their transferability into practice In this work we introduce QSPRpred a toolkit for analysis of bioactivity data sets and QSPR modelling which attempts to address the aforementioned challenges QSPRpreds modular Python API enables users to intuitively describe different parts of a modelling workflow using a plethora of preimplemented components but also integrates customized implementations in a plugandplay manner QSPRpred data sets and models are directly serializable which means they can be readily reproduced and put into operation after training as the models are saved with all required data preprocessing steps to make predictions on new compounds directly from SMILES strings The generalpurpose character of QSPRpred is also demonstrated by inclusion of support for multitask and proteochemometric modelling The package is extensively documented and comes with a large collection of tutorials to help new users In this paper we describe all of QSPRpreds functionalities and also conduct a small benchmarking case study to illustrate how different components can be leveraged to compare a diverse set of models QSPRpred is fully opensource and available at httpsgithubcomCDDLeidenQSPRpred Scientific ContributionQSPRpred aims to provide a complex but comprehensive Python API to conduct all tasks encountered in QSPR modelling from data preparation and analysis to model creation and model deployment In contrast to similar packages QSPRpred offers a wider and more exhaustive range of capabilities and integrations with many popular packages that also go beyond QSPR modelling A significant contribution of QSPRpred is also in its automated and highly standardized serialization scheme which significantly improves reproducibility and transferability of models  2024 The Authors

microorganisms However how the host regulates the secretion and glycosylation of these mucins in response to bacterial invasion remains unclear Our study demonstrates that when exposed to Streptococcus gallolyticus SGG a gut pathobiont the host mucosa promptly adjusts the behavior of specialized goblet cells GCs located in the middle of the crypts A subset of these cells undergoes a remodeling becoming intercrypt goblet cells icGCs which do not detach from the surface but instead migrate along intercrypt spaces while secreting a mucus impermeable to bacterial pathogens Significantly a nonpiliated SGG mutant unable to bind to mucus fails to induce icGCs allowing its translocation through the mucosa and submucosa Interestingly a closely related nonpathogenic bacterium SGM able to bind to mucus also triggers the differentiation of GCs into icGCs This discovery opens new avenues for treating patients with a leaky gut as observed in intestinal diseases such as inflammatory bowel diseases and metabolic disorders but also patients with a history of repeated antibiotic use Utilizing mucusadherent probiotics to induce icGCs represents a promising strategy for reinforcing the mucosal barrier DOI 1010801949097620242426609 PMCID PMC11572077 PMID 39543081 Indexed for MEDLINE Conflict of interest statement No potential conflict of interest was reported by the

three types of druginduced liver injury DILI Cholestasis is characterized by the disruption of bile flow leading to intrahepatic accumulation of toxic bile acids Bile acid regulation is a multifarious process orchestrated by several hepatic mechanisms namely sinusoidal uptake and efflux canalicular secretion and intracellular metabolism In the present study we developed a prediction model of DIC using in vitro inhibition data for 47 marketed drugs on nine transporters and five enzymes known to regulate bile acid homeostasis The resulting model was able to distinguish between drugs with or without DILI concern pvalue  0039 and demonstrated a satisfactory predictive performance with the area under the precisionrecall curve PR AUC measured at 091 Furthermore we simplified the model considering only two processes namely reversible inhibition of OATP1B1 and timedependent inhibition of CYP3A4 which provided an enhanced performance PR AUC  095 Our study supports literature findings suggesting a contribution not only from a single process inhibition but a rather synergistic effect of the key bile acid clearance processes in the development of cholestasis The use of a quantitative model in the preclinical investigations of DIC is expected to reduce attrition rate in advanced development programs and guide the discovery and development of safe medicines  2024 The Authors under

BACKGROUND Among gliomas the most common primary malignant brain tumor incidental gliomas account for 255 of cases The controversy over whether to pursue immediate treatment or adopt a waitandsee approach remains and more molecular and immunological evidence is needed for definitive treatment decisions METHODS Total RNA sequencing RNAseq data and single cell RNA sequencing scRNAseq data were retrospectively analyzed to compare the molecular and immunological tumor microenvironment differences between incidental glioma and symptomatic glioma samples These were classified using symptom data from The Cancer Genome Atlas TCGA and public dataset RESULTS RNAseq analysis of the GBMLGG dataset identified 343 genes upregulated in symptomatic glioma and 118 in incidental glioma with 104 common genes upregulated in symptomatic glioma across both the TCGA and Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas CGGA datasets Enrichment analysis revealed that these 104 genes in symptomatic glioma were significantly associated with immunological pathways scRNAseq analysis of glioma revealed 11 cell types including T cells myeloid cells and oligodendrocytes with the tumor necrosis factor TNF signaling pathway strongly influencing other cell types particularly myeloid cells Enrichment and survival analyses showed that TNF signaling is associated with temozolomide resistance and poorer prognosis in glioma patients CONCLUSION The findings suggest that symptomatic glioma enhances inflammatory responses linked to poor prognosis and chemoresistance This supports the hypothesis that immediate treatment of incidental glioma may improve patient outcomes over a waitandsee approach Copyright  2024 The Korean Brain Tumor Society The Korean Society for NeuroOncology and The Korean Society for Pediatric

UNIQUE A Framework for Uncertainty Quantification Benchmarking Lanini J1 Huynh MTD1 Scebba G1 Schneider N1 Rodr\u00edguezP\u00e9rez R1 Author information 1Novartis Biomedical Research Novartis Campus 4002 Basel Switzerland Machine learning ML models have become key in decisionmaking for many disciplines including drug discovery and medicinal chemistry ML models are generally evaluated prior to their usage in highstakes decisions such as compound synthesis or experimental testing However no ML model is robust or predictive in all realworld scenarios Therefore uncertainty quantification UQ in ML predictions has gained importance in recent years Many investigations have focused on developing methodologies that provide accurate uncertainty estimates for MLbased predictions Unfortunately there is no UQ strategy that consistently provides robust estimates about models applicability on new samples Depending on the dataset prediction task and algorithm accurate uncertainty estimations might be unfeasible to obtain Moreover the optimum UQ metric also varies across applications and previous investigations have shown a lack of consistency across benchmarks Herein the UNIQUE UNcertaInty QUantification bEnchmarking framework is introduced to facilitate a comparison of UQ strategies in MLbased predictions This Python library unifies the benchmarking of multiple UQ metrics including the calculation of nonstandard UQ metrics combining information from the dataset and model and provides a comprehensive evaluation In this framework UQ metrics are evaluated for different application scenarios eg eliminating the predictions with the lowest confidence or obtaining a reliable uncertainty estimate for an acquisition function Taken together this library will help to standardize UQ investigations and evaluate new methodologies DOI 101021acsjcim4c01578 PMID 39542432", "1 Cell Mol Gastroenterol Hepatol 2024 Nov 12101429 doi 101016jjcmgh2024101429 Online ahead of

overexpression HSC activation was assessed by cell expression of activation markers PM Glut1 glucose uptake and glycolysis of HSCs were analyzed by biotinylation 2NBDGbased assay and Seahorse Glycolysis Stress Test Phosphomutants of vasodilatorstimulated phosphorylated protein VASP were created by sitedirected mutagenesis TGF\u03b2 transcriptome was obtained by RNA sequencing Singlecell RNA sequencing datasets and immunofluorescence were leveraged to analyze PKM\u03b6 expression in cancerassociated fibroblasts CAFs of colorectal liver metastases Function of HSC PKM\u03b6 was

critical role in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma PDAC biology Recent studies indicate that the combination of MEK and BCLxL inhibition is synthetically lethal and holds promise for some types of solid cancers however patient response was poorly observed in PDAC predominantly due to amplified EGFR signaling Here we leverage the advantage of the combinational treatment strategy and designed a triplet regimen targeting the comprehensive RAS activation networks through simultaneously blocking MEKBCLxLEGFR The cytotoxicity of trametinib MEK inhibitor DT2216 BCLxL degrader and afatinib panEGFR inhibitor and their combination was tested in patientderived primary PDAC cells using a live cell imaging system Patientderived xenograft PDX model was employed for the evaluation of the therapeutic efficacy and safety of the combinational regimen Targeted pathway cascades activities were analyzed using multiplex phosphorimmune assays In vitro comparisons showed the addition of afatinib as a third agent was statistically superior compared to a doublet of trametinibDT2216 in suppressing cell growth and inducing cell death in all cell lines tested This triplet similarly demonstrated significant superiority over the doublet of MEKBCLxL inhibition in the in vivo murine model The triplet regimen was well tolerated in vivo Overall tumor growth rates were significantly reduced in doublet treatment compared to controls and further reduced in the triplet treatment group Pathway analysis revealed the addition of afatinib in triplet regimen further inhibited PI3KAKT effectors of

University of South Carolina Columbia SC 29208 Triplenegative breast cancers TNBC are treated primarily by chemotherapy and lack clinically validated therapeutic targets In particular inhibitors of the PI3KAKTmTOR pathway abnormally activated in many breast cancers failed to achieve clinical efficacy in TNBC due to the development of adaptive drug resistance which is largely driven by the transcriptomic plasticity of TNBC Expression of CDK819 Mediator kinases that control transcriptional reprogramming correlates with relapsefree survival and treatment failure in breast cancer patients including TNBC We now investigated how CDK819 inhibitors affect the growth of TNBC tumors and their response to mTOR and AKT inhibitors In contrast to the effects of most anticancer drugs all the tested human TNBC models including patientderived xenografts responded to CDK819 inhibitors in vivo even when they did not respond in vitro Furthermore CDK819 inhibition extended the host survival of established lung metastases in a murine TNBC model where the primary tumors were not significantly affected CDK819 inhibitors synergized with an mTORC1 inhibitor everolimus and a panAKT inhibitor capivasertib in vitro and strongly potentiated these drugs in longterm in vivo studies Transcriptomic analysis of tumors that responded or became adapted to everolimus revealed that drug adaptation in vivo was associated with major transcriptional changes in both tumor and stromal cells Combining everolimus with a CDK819 inhibitor counteracted many of these changes and induced combinationspecific effects on the expression of multiple genes that affect tumor growth These results warrant the exploration of CDK819 Mediator kinase inhibitors as a new type of drugs for TNBC therapy DOI

Testicular germ cell tumor TGCT is a common malignant tumor in adolescents Now many long noncoding RNAs LncRNAs have been found to have an important function in TGCT LINC00470 is specifically and highly expressed in TGCT however there is still no definite information concerning its role and underlying mechanism in TGCT The purpose of this research was to look into the involvement of LINC00470 in TGCT and its intrinsic mechanism METHODS AND RESULTS UCSC and GEPIA2 databases were used to analyze the expression of LINC00470 and the BEST website was used to perform GSEA enrichment analysis immune infiltration analysis and drug susceptibility analysis SiRNA transfection was used to silence LINC00470 in TCAM2 and NCCIT cells Clone formation and Transwell assays were performed in TGCT cells to confirm the effects of LINC00470 on clone formation migration and invasion Western Blot was performed to determine the expression of proteins related to the EMT and AKT signaling pathways LINC00470 was specifically highly expressed in TGCT and played a role in promoting tumor cell clone formation and cell metastasis by affecting the TGF\u03b2 and PI3KAKTmTOR signaling pathways to regulate the epithelialmesenchymal transition EMT process LINC00470 may also play a protumor role by negatively regulating immune infiltration in addition the expression of LINC00470 was negatively correlated with the chemosensitivity of cisplatin in TGCT patients CONCLUSIONS LINC00470 may play a significant role in the etiology and metastasis of TGCT through EMT and AKTmediated signaling

MOTIVATION Assigning accurate property labels to proteins like functional terms and catalytic activity is challenging especially for proteins without homologs and tail labels with few known examples Previous methods mainly focused on protein sequence features overlooking the semantic meaning of protein labels RESULTS We introduce FAPM a contrastive multimodal model that links natural language with protein sequence language This model combines a pretrained protein sequence model with a pretrained large language model to generate labels such as Gene Ontology GO functional terms and catalytic activity predictions in natural language Our results show that FAPM excels in understanding protein properties outperforming models based solely on protein sequences or structures It achieves stateoftheart performance on public benchmarks and inhouse experimentally annotated phage proteins which often have few known homologs Additionally FAPMs flexibility allows it to incorporate extra text prompts like taxonomy information enhancing both its predictive performance and explainability This novel approach offers a promising alternative to current methods that rely on multiple sequence

adipose tissue and its levels in human blood are relatively low However because of FDs high turnover rate therapeutic targeting with monoclonal antibodies and chemical inhibitors has been challenging The recent discovery that FD activity is regulated by mannosebinding lectinassociated serine protease 3 MASP3 through conversion of a zymogen to mature FD has sparked interest in MASP3 inhibition as a new way to block FD function and AP complement activity Here we review studies of mouse models of FD and MASP3 inhibition We additionally discuss the lessons learned from these studies and their

Clinical Research Center for Pediatric Nephrology Chengdu Sichuan China 3College of Pharmacy Harbin Medical University Harbin Heilongjiang China Hyperuricemia is a metabolic disorder characterized by elevated serum uric acid levels Soluble urate can activate immune responses and the excessive accumulation of urate in the kidneys results in hyperuricemic nephropathy HN However the lack of an established HN model is a major obstacle to advancing research into the pathogenesis of HN and the development of novel drugs In this study we generated and evaluated an optimized mouse model of HN by the combined administration of potassium oxonate and hypoxanthine at various dosages Our results demonstrated that intraperitoneal injection of 200 mgkg potassium oxonate with gavage of 500 mgkg hypoxanthine caused renal injury in mice as evidenced by the elevation in serum uric acid serum creatinine and 24 h albuminuria levels as well as pathological changes in renal histology Intraperitoneal injection of 200 mgkg potassium oxonate with gavage of 500 mgkg hypoxanthine markedly increased the production of uric acid inhibited uricase activity and disrupted uric acid transporters This led to supersaturated urate deposition in the kidneys triggering renal inflammation and fibrosis thereby promoting HN progression In conclusion we successfully established a stable and efficient mouse model that can mimic the pathogenesis of HN This novel model may facilitate the discovery of therapeutic targets and the development of new drugs for the treatment of HN DOI

treatment of acute rhinosinusitis in the context of increasing antibiotic resistance Arcimowicz M1 Author information 1Department of Otorhinolaryngology Medical University of Warsaw Poland Acute rhinosinusitis is one of the most common diseases in the population both in primary and specialist otolaryngological care It is also responsible for a disturbingly high percentage of prescribed antibiotic therapy regardless of the etiology of the disease Despite the fact that acute viral and acute postviral rhinosinusitis dominate among the phenotypes of acute rhinosinusitis and the development of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis occurs in only 052 of all cases in adults and 510 in children antibiotics still remain an important element of treatment despite alarming data on the growing antibiotic resistance and the adverse effect of antibiotics on the human microbiome leading to dysbiosis The discovery of antibiotics was one of the greatest achievements of modern medicine but their inappropriate use leads to the gradual increase in the phenomenon of antibiotic resistance considered one of the most serious public health problems recognized by the WHO as one of the 10 greatest threats to human health in the 21ltsupgtstltsupgt century The unjustified use of antibiotics in outpatient care is the key to the growth of this problem in parallel with the lack of patient compliance The COVID pandemic has intensified this unfavourable trend That is why the knowledge of antibiotic stewardship is so important According to the guidelines in the therapy of acute rhinosinusitis symptomatic and antiinflammatory treatment dominates and antibiotic therapy has very strictly defined and limited indications The latest guidelines also recommend herbal medicines including BNO 1016 in the treatment of acute viral and postviral rhinosinusitis Available studies indicate that it has a beneficial effect not only on shortening the duration of the disease and reducing symptoms but also reduces the need for antibiotic treatment in acute rhinosinusitis Complications of acute rhinosinusitis are relatively rare and are not related to taking antibiotics DOI

HBV is a doublestranded DNA virus but its life cycle involves an intermediate stage during which pregenomic RNA pgRNA is encapsulated in the capsid and then reversetranscribed into the minus DNA strand These immature HBV virions are the key target for antiviral drug discovery In this study we investigate the flexibility and mechanical stability of the HBV capsid containing pgRNA by employing residueresolved coarsegrained molecular dynamics simulations The results showed that the presence of pgRNA tends to decrease the overall flexibility of the capsid In addition the symmetrically arranged subunits of the capsid show asymmetry in the dominant modes of the conformational fluctuations with or without the presence of pgRNA Furthermore the simulations revealed that the presence of pgRNA enhances the overall mechanical stability of the virion particle Electrostatic interactions between the disordered CTD of capsid and pgRNA were found to play a crucial role in modulating viral mechanical stability Decreasing the electrostatic interactions by CTD phosphorylation or high salt concentration significantly reduces the mechanical stability of the HBV capsid containing pgRNA Finally the 2fold symmetric sites have been proposed to be the most vulnerable to rupture during the initial stages of capsid disassembly These findings could enhance our understanding of the physical

fed into PreissHandler pathway for NAD biosynthesis which is an important enzyme cofactor and crucial for redox balance in microorganisms Pathogens like methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus MRSA are NAD auxotroph and rely on their host environment for NAD precursors to synthesize NAD Mutations in nicotinamidasePncA have been reported to be associated with resistance to pyrazinamide PZA a frontline antitubercular drug underlying its importance as an important link in NAD biosynthesis network in pathogenic organisms such as MRSA The conserved features of PncA and essentiality of salvage route in MRSA and the absence of this enzyme in humans and other eukaryotes are attractive options to explore therapeutics against this target In this work we have screened novel substrate analogs from the PubChem database using virtual screening approaches employing fingerprint tanimotobased 2D similarity search against Staphylococcus aureus PncA SaPncA Identified compounds were further assessed using molecular dynamics simulations to investigate conformational stability and structural integrity We propose two analogs namely L28 and L33 with greater stability favorable binding and strong binding free energies in MMPBSA calculations The strategy could provide an important clue in developing similar compound scaffolds as potent druglike molecules against MRSA and other pathogenic

gene clusters BGCs in Streptomyces which represent a large and hidden reservoir of natural products However such approaches are not applicable to most Streptomyces strains with reasons to be comprehended Inspired by the prevalence of the class 1 subtype especially the type IE CRISPR system in Streptomyces here we report the development of the type IE CRISPR system into a series of transcriptional regulation tools We further demonstrate the effectiveness of such activators in nine phylogenetically distant Streptomyces strains Using these tools we successfully activate 13 out of 21 BGCs and lead to the identification and characterization of one polyketide one Ripp and three alkaloid products Our work is expected to have a profound impact and to facilitate the discovery of

neuropathy and the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide However the early detection of glaucoma remains challenging as chronic forms of glaucoma remain largely asymptomatic until considerable irreversible visual field deficits have ensued Thus biomarkers that facilitate early diagnosis and treatment for glaucoma patients with a high risk of progression are pressing METHODS AND ANALYSIS Human diseasebiomarker interactions network and human diseasetargetdrug interactions network were first constructed based on multiomics data The greedy search algorithm was used to search for the hub biomarkers and drug targets for glaucoma Genomewide association studies and epidemiological data from the UK Biobank were used to verify our results Biological network and functional analysis was conducted to find common network features and pathways RESULTS We identified 10 hub biomarkersdrug targets for the diagnosis treatment and prognosis for glaucoma These results were verified by text mining and genomicepidemiology data We also predicted the new application of BMP1 and MMP9 to diagnose glaucoma and confirm the theory of hub biomarkers with multiple clinical applications Further relevant pivotal pathways for these hub biomolecules were discovered which may serve as foundations for future biomarker and drug target prediction for glaucoma CONCLUSION We have used a networkbased approach to identify hub diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers for glaucoma and detected relationships between glaucoma and associated diseases Several hub biomarkers were identified and verified which may play more important roles in the diagnosis and treatment of glaucoma  Authors or their employers 2024 Reuse permitted under CC BYNC No commercial reuse See rights and permissions

of Medical Life Science Yokohama City University Proteolysistargeting chimeras PROTACs have attracted attention as an innovative drug modality that induces the selective degradation of target proteins This technology shows higher activity than conventional inhibitors and holds great potential in the field of drug discovery Optimization of the linker is essential for PROTACs to achieve sufficient activity particularly with regard to cell membrane permeability However the correlation between membrane permeability and the activity of PROTACs has not been fully explored To address this we established a new molecular design approach to remove the linker and optimize PROTAC structure These PROTAC compound groups were used to analyze the correlation between membrane permeability and activity using LCtandem mass spectrometry LCMSMS Results revealed that the degradation activity of PROTACs fluctuates with increasing membrane permeability and changes in response to linker optimization while sufficient proteolytic activity can be retained These findings demonstrate the importance of considering the balance between membrane permeability and activity in PROTAC design and

characterized neuropathologically by TDP43 proteinopathy with loss of TDP43 nuclear splicing activity and formation of cytoplasmic TDP43 aggregates The lack of suitable experimental models of TDP43 proteinopathy has hampered the discovery of effective therapies We already showed that chronic and mild oxidative insult by sodium arsenite ARS triggered TDP43 cytoplasmic aggregation and stress granules SGs formation in ALS patientderived fibroblasts and motor neurons differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells iPSCMNs However whether this insult induces a reduction of TDP43 splicing activity in the nucleus thus recapitulating both gain and loss of function pathomechanisms still remains to be determined In this study we first showed that chronic ARS in human neuroblastoma cells triggered TDP43 cytoplasmic mislocalization SGs formation and defective splicing of TDP43 target genes UNC13A and POLDIP3 as functional readouts of TDP43 proteinopathy Additionally a dysregulation of autophagy and senescence markers was observed in this condition In a preliminary drug screening approach with autophagypromoting drugs namely rapamycin lithium carbonate and metformin only rapamycin prevented ARSinduced loss of TDP43 splicing activity We then demonstrated that in addition to TDP43 cytoplasmic aggregation chronic ARS triggered TDP43 loss of splicing activity also in ALS patientderived primary fibroblasts and iPSCMNs and that rapamycin was beneficial to reduce these TDP43 pathological features By switching to a neuroglial 3D in vitro model we observed that treatment of ALS iPSCbrain organoids with chronic ARS also induced a defective TDP43 splicing activity which was prevented by rapamycin Collectively we established different human cell models of TDP43 proteinopathy which recapitulate TDP43 gain and loss of function prevented by rapamycin administration Human neuroblastoma cells and patientderived fibroblasts and 2D and 3DiPSC models exposed to
